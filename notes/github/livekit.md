# livekit
## Summary
LiveKit is an open-source real-time communications stack for video, audio, and data built on WebRTC. It is designed for production deployments with distributed SFU architecture, authentication, and robust network traversal support. The project serves as core infrastructure for both human collaboration and AI real-time interaction apps.
## Key Points
- Provides a scalable, distributed WebRTC SFU server implemented in Go.
- Includes support for production concerns like JWT auth, TURN, and multi-region deployment.
- Offers advanced RTC features such as simulcast, selective subscription, and moderation APIs.
- Backed by an ecosystem of SDKs and companion projects (agents, ingress, egress).
