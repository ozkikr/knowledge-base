# Sketch

## Summary
An AI code-writing assistant for pandas users that understands your data's context. Registers as a pandas DataFrame extension, enabling natural language queries for data cataloging, engineering, and analysis without any IDE plugin.

## Key Points
- Three main methods: `.sketch.ask` (Q&A), `.sketch.howto` (code generation), `.sketch.apply` (data generation)
- Uses data sketches (efficient approximation algorithms) to summarize data and feed context to LLMs
- Supports local models (MPT-7B, StarCoder) or OpenAI API directly
- Covers full data workflow: PII identification, metadata generation, cleaning, feature extraction, visualization
- Install with `pip install sketch`; works in Jupyter/Colab out of the box
