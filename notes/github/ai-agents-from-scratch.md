# ai-agents-from-scratch
## Summary
ai-agents-from-scratch is a hands-on educational repository for learning agent design by implementing components directly. It walks through fundamentals such as prompting, tool calling, memory, and ReAct loops using local models. The project is structured as progressive examples intended to build first-principles understanding before framework use.
## Key Points
- Presents a staged learning path from basic LLM calls to agentic reasoning patterns.
- Covers practical concepts including function calling, persistence, and iterative action loops.
- Pairs executable examples with conceptual and code-level explanations.
- Encourages local-first experimentation to expose agent internals clearly.
