# Skald - Open Source Production RAG

## Summary
Skald is a plug-and-play production-ready RAG platform that can be self-hosted in your infrastructure. It handles the full pipeline — document parsing, chunking, embeddings, vector storage, query rewriting, vector search, reranking, and LLM chat — with configurable defaults and SDKs in multiple languages.

## Key Points
- Production-ready RAG with solid defaults and full configurability
- Handles ingestion (parsing, chunking, embedding) and retrieval (search, reranking, chat)
- SDKs for Python, Node, Go, Ruby, PHP, and C#
- Self-hostable with support for fully local/open-source stack
- Built-in evaluation and performance monitoring
