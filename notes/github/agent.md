# Stakpak Agent

## Summary
An open-source, security-hardened DevOps AI agent for the terminal. It uses secret substitution so LLMs never see actual credentials, warden guardrails to block destructive operations, and curated DevOps playbooks (Rulebooks) for infrastructure tasks.

## Key Points
- Secret substitution prevents LLM from seeing actual credentials
- Warden guardrails block destructive operations at the network level
- Built-in DevOps playbooks via Stakpak Rulebooks
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for encrypted MCP communication
- Generate infra code, debug Kubernetes, configure CI/CD safely
