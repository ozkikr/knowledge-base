# pipecat-mcp-server
## Summary
Pipecat MCP Server exposes voice and screen-capture tools to MCP-compatible coding agents such as Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex. It focuses on integrating conversational agents with external audio/video transports rather than providing native device I/O itself. The project offers a practical bridge between text-first agent clients and real-time voice interfaces.

## Key Points
- Implements MCP endpoints for voice-agent tooling and screen analysis workflows.
- Supports multiple transports (browser playground, Daily, telephony providers) for audio access.
- Documents client setup patterns for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.
- Encourages safety controls via explicit tool permissions and optional talk skill confirmations.
- Designed as an extensible base for voice-enabled MCP applications.
