# Skybridge
## Summary
Skybridge is a full-stack TypeScript framework for building ChatGPT Apps and MCP-compatible apps with typed server/widget integration. It adds developer ergonomics (HMR, dev tooling, typed hooks) on top of lower-level MCP/App SDK workflows. The framework is positioned as platform-agnostic across ChatGPT and other MCP clients.

## Key Points
- Provides `skybridge/server` and `skybridge/web` modules with end-to-end type inference.
- Supports React-style hooks and state patterns for building interactive AI widgets.
- Emphasizes widget-to-model synchronization so UI state and model context stay aligned.
- Includes Vite-based local dev experience with hot reload and debugging tools.
- Offers multiple production-style example apps (maps, ecommerce, dashboards, starter kits).
