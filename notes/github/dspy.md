# DSPy

## Summary
DSPy is a framework from Stanford NLP for programming—rather than prompting—language models. It allows building modular AI systems with algorithms for optimizing prompts and weights, supporting classifiers, RAG pipelines, and agent loops. DSPy stands for Declarative Self-improving Python.

## Key Points
- Replaces brittle prompts with compositional Python code
- Includes algorithms to automatically optimize prompts and weights
- Supports building classifiers, RAG pipelines, and agent loops
- Published at ICLR 2024 by Omar Khattab et al.
- Active community via Discord and extensive documentation at dspy.ai
