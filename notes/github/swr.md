# SWR

## Summary
SWR is a React Hooks library for data fetching by Vercel. Named after the "stale-while-revalidate" HTTP cache invalidation strategy, it returns cached data first, then revalidates, providing fast and reactive UI updates with built-in caching, deduplication, and error retry.

## Key Points
- Stale-while-revalidate caching strategy
- Built-in request deduplication, polling, and smart error retry
- Supports SSR/SSG, React Suspense, and React Native
- Optimistic UI via local mutation
- Lightweight, transport and protocol agnostic
