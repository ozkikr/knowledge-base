## Key Points
- Used in production by InfluxDB, Bleve, Weaviate, SourceGraph, M3, and more
- Recommended over other bitmap compression methods (Wang et al., SIGMOD 2017)
- Also used by Google Procella (YouTube SQL Engine) for indexing
- Part of the Awesome Go collection
- Implementations exist in Java, C/C++, C#, Rust, Python, and more
