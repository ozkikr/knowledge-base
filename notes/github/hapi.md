# hapi
## Summary
HAPI is a local-first wrapper that lets users run official coding agents locally while controlling sessions remotely via web, PWA, or Telegram mini app. It emphasizes seamless handoff between desktop and mobile workflows without resetting context. The tool is designed for users who want agent continuity and remote approvals while away from their primary machine.

## Key Points
- Wraps existing agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode) instead of replacing their native runtime.
- Enables remote session interaction, command execution, and permission approvals from mobile devices.
- Supports encrypted relay-based connectivity for secure remote access.
- Provides voice assistant support for hands-free control.
- Prioritizes local-first operation with optional self-hosted networking setups.
