# Hex
## Summary
Hex is a macOS voice-to-text utility that transcribes speech and pastes output into the active app. It uses a press-and-hold hotkey model and supports both cloud-optimized and on-device transcription options. The project is built as a desktop-first productivity tool for rapid dictation.

## Key Points
- Captures voice from a global hotkey and inserts transcribed text system-wide.
- Supports Parakeet TDT via FluidAudio and WhisperKit-based workflows.
- Offers hold-to-record and lock recording interaction patterns.
- Requires microphone and accessibility permissions for end-to-end operation.
