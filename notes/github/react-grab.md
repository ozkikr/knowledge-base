# react-grab
## Summary
React Grab is a developer utility that captures UI element context from running React apps and copies it for use in coding agents. By pressing a hotkey over an element, developers can export component/file/HTML context to reduce prompt friction. The tool integrates with popular frameworks and can connect to agents directly or via MCP.
## Key Points
- Captures file name, component location, and HTML snippet from hovered UI elements.
- Designed to improve speed/accuracy when prompting tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot.
- Supports quick setup via CLI plus manual setup for Next.js, Vite, and Webpack.
- Includes commands to add/remove direct agent integrations and MCP integration.
- Exposes a plugin API (`__REACT_GRAB__`) for extensions and custom workflows.
