# mcp-rubber-duck
## Summary
mcp-rubber-duck is an MCP server for querying multiple LLM providers and CLI coding agents through one interface. It emphasizes comparative reasoning workflows such as voting, debating, and iterative refinement across models. The project extends the classic “rubber duck” debugging concept into a structured multi-model assistant pattern.
## Key Points
- Supports OpenAI-compatible HTTP providers plus local CLI agents like Claude Code and Codex.
- Includes “duck council,” voting, judging, and debate-style orchestration tools.
- Offers guardrails, usage tracking, and health/failover controls for safer operations.
- Provides MCP prompt templates for recurring analysis and decision workflows.
