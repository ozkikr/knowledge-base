# CodMate
## Summary
CodMate is a macOS SwiftUI application for organizing and resuming AI coding CLI sessions across multiple tools. It combines transcript browsing, project/task organization, and Git review features in a desktop UI. The maintainer notes plans to archive the project while shifting focus to orchestration-first workflows.

- Adds project/task organization, tagging, and search-centric navigation.
- Supports resume/new session flows across Terminal, iTerm2, and Warp.
- Includes Git Changes review and optional AI-generated commit messages.
- Implements local storage for notes, indexes, providers, and MCP config.
