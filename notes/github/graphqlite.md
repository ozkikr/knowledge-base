# GraphQLite

## Summary
GraphQLite is a SQLite extension that adds graph database capabilities with Cypher query language support. It enables storing and querying graph data in a single-file embedded database with built-in graph algorithms like PageRank, Louvain, and Dijkstra.

## Key Points
- Cypher queries: MATCH, CREATE, MERGE, SET, DELETE, WITH, UNWIND, RETURN
- Built-in algorithms: PageRank, Louvain community detection, Dijkstra, BFS/DFS, connected components
- Zero configuration — works with any SQLite database, no server required
- Python, Rust, and raw SQL interfaces; installable via pip, cargo, or Homebrew
- Includes GraphRAG examples with HotpotQA dataset
