# Deepnote

## Summary
Deepnote is an AI-first, open-source successor to Jupyter notebooks. It introduces the `.deepnote` YAML format for human-readable, version-control-friendly notebooks with block-based architecture, reactive execution, and native AI agent support.

## Key Points
- `.deepnote` YAML format replaces `.ipynb` JSON for better version control
- Block-based architecture: Code, SQL, Text, Inputs, Charts, and more
- Reactive notebook execution auto-reruns dependent blocks
- Extensions for VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and JupyterLab
- Seamless conversion between `.ipynb` and `.deepnote` formats
