# Vectorless

## Summary
Vectorless is a PDF chatbot that uses no vector embeddings or traditional RAG. Instead, it uses LLM reasoning for document selection and page relevance detection in a completely stateless, privacy-first approach where documents stay in the browser.

## Key Points
- No vector database needed—uses LLM reasoning instead of embeddings
- 3-step process: LLM document selection → page relevance detection → answer generation
- Completely stateless and privacy-first (documents stay in browser)
- Real-time processing without pre-indexing
- Preserves full document context unlike embedding approaches
