# ChatMock
## Summary
ChatMock runs a local OpenAI/Ollama-compatible API server powered by an authenticated ChatGPT account instead of a traditional API key. It is designed for developers who want to use coding tools and chat UIs against GPT models via their ChatGPT subscription. The repo provides CLI, GUI, and Docker workflows for different environments.
## Key Points
- Exposes OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`) on a local server.
- Uses ChatGPT account authentication and supports GPT-5 family and Codex-style models.
- Supports tool/function calling, vision, and configurable reasoning settings.
- Offers multiple install routes: macOS app, Homebrew, Python script usage, and Docker.
- Requires an active paid ChatGPT account and is positioned as an unofficial educational project.
