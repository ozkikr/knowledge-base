# Agor

## Summary
A multiplayer spatial canvas (think Figma for AI coding) that orchestrates Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini sessions. Manages git worktrees, tracks AI conversations, and visualizes agentic work in real-time with workflow zones and isolated test environments.

## Key Points
- Spatial canvas UI for coordinating multiple AI coding assistants in parallel
- GitHub-linked worktrees with automated workflow zones
- Live collaboration with cursors and comments
- Requires Node.js 20.x and Zellij for persistent terminal sessions
- Rich web UI for viewing AI conversations
