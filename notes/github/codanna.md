# Codanna

## Summary
Codanna provides "x-ray vision" for coding agents—semantic code search, call graph tracking, and dependency analysis via MCP. Built for rapid R&D and pair programming, it understands code structure rather than just matching strings.

## Key Points
- Semantic search: natural language queries against code and documentation
- Relationship tracking: call graphs, implementations, dependencies across files
- Document search (RAG) for markdown/text files
- MCP integration for AI coding assistants
- Install via curl, Homebrew, or Cargo
