# RAGChecker

## Summary
RAGChecker is an advanced automatic evaluation framework from Amazon Science for assessing and diagnosing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It provides fine-grained claim-level entailment metrics for both retrieval and generation components. Accepted at NeurIPS Dataset and Benchmark Track.

## Key Points
- Holistic evaluation with overall metrics for entire RAG pipeline
- Diagnostic metrics for both retriever and generator components separately
- Fine-grained evaluation using claim-level entailment operations
- Includes benchmark dataset with 4k questions across 10 domains
- Meta-evaluation with human-annotated preference dataset
