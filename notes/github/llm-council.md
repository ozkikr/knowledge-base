# LLM Council — Multiple LLMs Answer Together

## Summary
LLM Council by Andrej Karpathy is a local web app that sends your query to multiple LLMs via OpenRouter, has them review and rank each other's work anonymously, then a Chairman LLM produces the final consensus response.

## Key Points
- Stage 1: All LLMs answer independently with tab view for comparison
- Stage 2: Anonymized cross-review where each LLM ranks others on accuracy and insight
- Stage 3: Chairman LLM compiles final answer from all responses
- Uses OpenRouter for multi-model access
- Self-described "vibe coded" Saturday hack project
