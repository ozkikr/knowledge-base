# Plano

## Summary
Plano is an AI-native proxy server and data plane for agentic applications. It offloads common plumbing work like agent routing, orchestration, guardrails, and observability so developers can focus on core agent logic using any language or AI framework.

## Key Points
- Provides low-latency orchestration between agents without modifying app code
- Supports model routing by name, alias, or automatic preferences
- Zero-code capture of agentic signals plus OTEL traces/metrics
- Filter chains for jailbreak protection, moderation policies, and memory hooks
- Framework-agnostic: works with any language or AI framework
