# Stable-DiffCoder
## Summary
Stable-DiffCoder is a ByteDance Seed code diffusion model family with base and instruct variants at 8B scale. The project presents a diffusion-oriented training recipe and reports strong benchmark results versus autoregressive baselines. It provides open artifacts, technical report links, and practical inference examples.
## Key Points
- Introduces block diffusion continual pretraining with targeted warmup and noise scheduling.
- Reports improved coding benchmark performance under controlled training/data settings.
- Publishes model checkpoints and usage examples via Hugging Face and Transformers.
- Includes references to paper/technical report and reproducibility-oriented documentation.
