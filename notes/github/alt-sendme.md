# alt-sendme
## Summary
alt-sendme is an open-source peer-to-peer file transfer app for sending files/folders directly between devices without cloud storage, account signups, or size restrictions.

## Key Points

- Supports direct transfers with ticket-based sharing and resumable downloads.
- Designed as a privacy-focused alternative to centralized file-sharing services.
- Built with Rust + TypeScript/Tauri, with desktop distribution and active roadmap.
