# FlagEmbedding (BGE) - Retrieval Toolkit for Search and RAG

## Summary
FlagEmbedding provides the BGE (BAAI General Embedding) family of models, a one-stop retrieval toolkit for search and RAG applications. It includes state-of-the-art embedding models, rerankers, and multimodal embeddings (BGE-VL) for text and vision search applications.

## Key Points
- BGE embedding models widely used for RAG and semantic search
- BGE-VL multimodal embeddings for text-to-image, image-to-text search
- Includes MemoRAG for memory-inspired knowledge discovery
- LiteLLM integration for flexible model/embedding providers
- MIT licensed, free for academic and commercial use
