# beans
## Summary
Beans is a flat-file issue tracker built for both humans and coding agents. It stores tasks as Markdown in-repo so project planning and execution stay close to source code. The project also emphasizes agent-friendly querying and workflow automation.

## Key Points
- Keeps issues in a `.beans` directory using plain Markdown files.
- Provides a CLI plus an interactive TUI for creating and managing work.
- Includes GraphQL-powered querying to minimize token-heavy context retrieval.
- Supports agent priming patterns and integration hooks for tools like Claude Code.
