# Genkit

## Summary
Genkit is Google Firebase's open-source framework for building full-stack AI-powered applications. It provides a unified interface for integrating AI models from multiple providers (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) with SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Python. Production-ready for JS/TS and Go, with Python in alpha.

## Key Points
- Unified API across hundreds of models from multiple providers with structured output, tool calling, and agentic workflows
- Cross-language support: JS/TS and Go are production-ready; Python is in alpha
- Built-in developer tools with local CLI and Developer UI for testing prompts, comparing models, and debugging traces
- Deploy anywhere: Cloud Functions for Firebase, Google Cloud Run, or third-party platforms
- Production monitoring dashboard for tracking model performance, latency, error rates, and observability metrics
