## Key Points
- Uses script-based plugins to render custom menu bar content and dropdown actions.
- Supports rich plugin formatting, refresh intervals, and menu interactions via output conventions.
- Includes plugin discovery through an integrated repository browser.
- Compatible with legacy BitBar/xbar style plugin ecosystems.
- Installable via GitHub releases or Homebrew.
