# Conduit
## Summary
Conduit is a terminal UI for orchestrating multiple AI coding assistants, including Claude Code and Codex CLI. It introduces tab-based session management, streaming interaction, and usage/cost visibility in a single interface. The project focuses on practical multi-agent workflows for day-to-day software engineering tasks.

## Key Points
- Supports concurrent agent sessions with quick tab switching and session persistence.
- Streams model events in real time with both chat and raw event viewing modes.
- Tracks token usage and estimated costs to improve operational transparency.
- Includes keyboard-centric controls and import/resume flows for longer coding sessions.
