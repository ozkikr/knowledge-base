# CORE - Your Digital Brain

## Summary
CORE is an open-source memory agent that gives AI tools persistent memory and action capabilities. It replicates human memory by organizing episodes into topics, creating associations, and surfacing relevant context automatically across tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and others via MCP.

## Key Points
- Memory agent that classifies context (preferences, decisions, directives, problems, goals, knowledge)
- Surfaces right information at right time rather than context dumping
- Takes actions in Linear, GitHub, Slack, Gmail, Google Sheets
- Connect once via MCP, works across all coding agents
- Open-source and self-hostable
