# circlemind-ai/fast-graphrag
## Summary
fast-graphrag is a Python framework for graph-based retrieval-augmented generation focused on speed, cost efficiency, and interpretable retrieval. It builds and incrementally updates knowledge graphs, then explores them with PageRank-style methods for answer generation. The project emphasizes practical deployment with async typed APIs and low operational overhead.

## Key Points
- Provides an interpretable graph-based alternative to vanilla chunk-based RAG.
- Supports incremental graph updates as source data evolves.
- Uses graph exploration strategies inspired by personalized PageRank/HippoRAG ideas.
- Offers source and PyPI installation plus examples for query tuning and checkpointing.
- Claims notable cost reductions versus heavier GraphRAG pipelines.
