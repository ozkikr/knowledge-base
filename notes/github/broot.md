# Broot

## Summary
Broot is a terminal-based directory navigator that provides a new way to see and navigate directory trees. It offers fuzzy search, file previews, and quick cd functionality, making large directory structures manageable.

## Key Points
- Renders large directory trees in a compact, navigable view (unlike `tree`)
- Respects `.gitignore` files; toggle hidden/ignored files with shortcuts
- Fuzzy search with instant results; any keystroke interrupts current search
- `alt+enter` to cd into selected directory from the shell
- Supports file previews, custom verbs, and skin/theme customization
