# temporal-sdk-go-advanced
## Summary
A collection of advanced, unofficial utilities built around the Temporal Go SDK. The repository is explicitly experimental and intended for reuse without long-term API stability guarantees. It serves as a practical sandbox for specialized Temporal tooling beyond the core SDK.

## Key Points
- Hosts advanced add-on utilities rather than a single monolithic package.
- Includes `temporalproto` for generating Temporal workflow/activity protobuf artifacts.
- Includes `temporalsqlite` for SQLite-related Temporal workflow patterns.
- Maintained as “use at will” utilities without strict compatibility guarantees.
- Valuable for advanced Temporal users exploring niche workflow infrastructure needs.
