# Gambit
## Summary
Gambit is a developer-focused framework for composing reliable LLM workflows from small typed units called decks. It promotes explicit input/output schemas, local execution, and rich tracing to improve reproducibility. The project ships with CLI, REPL, and debug UI support for iterative workflow development.
## Key Points
- Builds workflows from typed deck components with guardrails and structured orchestration.
- Supports both model-powered and pure compute decks in the same execution graph.
- Provides local-first tooling: run/repl/serve commands, traces, and persisted session state.
- Includes testing and grading flows to evaluate non-trivial agent behavior.
