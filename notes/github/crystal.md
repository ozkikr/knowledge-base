# Crystal - Multi-Session AI Code Assistant Manager

## Summary
A desktop app that runs multiple Claude Code and Codex AI sessions in parallel git worktrees. Lets you work on multiple tasks simultaneously instead of waiting for agents to finish, with rich output display and isolated code copies.

## Key Points
- Run one or more sessions with Claude Code, Codex, or both
- Each session operates on an isolated copy of your code via git worktrees
- Desktop application with rich agent output rendering
- Test and compare different approaches side by side
- Manage AI-assisted development workflows in one unified app
