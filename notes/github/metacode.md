# Metacode

## Summary
Metacode is a Python library that proposes a standard language for machine-readable code comments. It aims to unify the disparate comment formats used by tools like Ruff, mypy, Black, Coverage, and Bandit into a single consistent standard.

## Key Points
- Addresses the lack of a unified standard for special comments used by Python source code analysis tools
- Covers formats like `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `# pragma: no cover`, `# fmt: off`, etc.
- Provides a library for parsing and working with these structured comments
- Available on PyPI via `pip install metacode`
