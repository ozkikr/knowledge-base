# Agentic Context Engine (ACE)

## Summary
ACE enables AI agents to learn from execution feedback—what works, what doesn't—and continuously improve without fine-tuning. It maintains a "Skillbook," a living document of strategies that evolves with each task, achieving 20-35% better performance and 49% token reduction.

## Key Points
- Agents learn from execution feedback automatically via in-context learning
- Maintains a Skillbook: patterns from successes, lessons from failures
- 20-35% performance improvement, 49% token reduction in browser automation benchmarks
- No fine-tuning or training data required
- Install via `pip install ace-framework`, supports multiple LLM providers via LiteLLM
