# zerobrew
## Summary
zerobrew is an experimental Homebrew-compatible client focused on faster package operations. It reuses the Homebrew ecosystem while optimizing installation and storage behavior. The project is positioned as a high-performance companion rather than a full replacement.

## Key Points
- Claims major speedups for cold and warm install scenarios.
- Uses content-addressable storage and APFS clonefile techniques.
- Supports package install, uninstall, bundle workflows, and garbage collection.
- Leverages Homebrew formula metadata and bottles where possible.
