# Mimir
## Summary
Mimir is an MCP-based memory and orchestration platform that combines graph storage with semantic search for persistent AI context. It targets long-running, multi-agent workflows where task relationships and historical context matter. The stack uses Neo4j-backed graph concepts and tooling for indexing, retrieval, and orchestration surfaces.
## Key Points
- Provides persistent memory across sessions with graph-style relationship modeling.
- Includes semantic indexing/search and optional embeddings-based retrieval flows.
- Offers web UI and orchestration tooling in addition to API-level integrations.
- Designed for multi-agent coordination and context continuity over time.
