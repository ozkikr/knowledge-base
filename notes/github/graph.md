# graph - Generic Graph Data Structures in Go

## Summary
A Go library for creating generic graph data structures with support for modifying, analyzing, and visualizing them. Features generic vertices, graph traits with validations, pathfinding/component algorithms, DOT/Graphviz visualization, and pluggable storage backends with ~90% test coverage and zero dependencies.

## Key Points
- Generic vertices of any type using Go generics
- Graph traits with validations (e.g., cycle checks in acyclic graphs)
- Algorithms: shortest paths, strongly connected components, DFS, BFS, topological order, transitive reduction
- DOT language / Graphviz visualization support
- Zero dependencies, ~90% test coverage, pluggable storage backends
