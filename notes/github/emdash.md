# Emdash

## Summary
Emdash is an open-source agentic development environment (YC W26) that lets you run multiple coding agents in parallel using any provider. It's provider-agnostic (15+ CLI agents including Claude Code, Qwen Code, Amp, Codex) and runs each agent in its own Git worktree to keep changes clean.

## Key Points
- Run multiple coding agents in parallel with isolated Git worktrees
- Provider-agnostic: supports 15+ CLI agents
- Hand off Linear, GitHub, or Jira tickets to agents and review diffs side-by-side
- Remote development via SSH/SFTP with secure credential storage
- Available on macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel), Linux, and Windows
