# MemoRAG - Memory-Inspired Knowledge Discovery for RAG

## Summary
MemoRAG is an innovative RAG framework built on a super-long memory model that achieves global understanding of entire databases. Unlike standard RAG, it recalls query-specific clues from memory to enhance evidence retrieval, resulting in more accurate and contextually rich responses. Accepted at TheWebConf 2025.

## Key Points
- Uses a dedicated memory model for global understanding of the entire database
- Recalls query-specific clues from memory to guide retrieval
- Supports Lite mode for processing millions of tokens with minimal code
- Works with Qwen2, Llama3.1, and Mistral as memory models
- Paper accepted at TheWebConf 2025
