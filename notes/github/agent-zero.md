# Agent Zero AI Framework

## Summary
A personal, organic agentic framework that grows and learns with the user. Unlike predefined frameworks, Agent Zero dynamically creates its own tools, supports multi-agent cooperation, and uses persistent memory. Fully transparent and customizable with no hard-coded rails.

## Key Points
- General-purpose assistant that uses the OS as a tool — writes its own code and creates tools as needed
- Multi-agent cooperation: agents create subordinates, report to superiors, keeping context clean
- Skills system using the open SKILL.md standard (compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.)
- Fully customizable — system prompt, tools, and message templates are all user-editable
- Supports Git-based projects with auth for public/private repos; Docker quick-start available
