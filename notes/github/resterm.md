# Resterm — Terminal API Client for HTTP/GraphQL/gRPC

## Summary
Resterm is a keyboard-driven terminal API client supporting REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, and SSE. It stores requests as plain .http/.rest files, supports SSH tunnels, OAuth 2.0, workflows, profiling, tracing, and response diffs — all local with no cloud sync.

## Key Points
- Supports REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, and SSE protocols
- Requests stored as plain .http/.rest files — version-controllable
- Built-in conditional logic (@when, @skip-if, @if/@elif/@else, @for-each)
- Multi-step workflows with data passing between steps
- RestermScript: a small expression language for request files
- Explicitly no AI integration — fully local, no telemetry
