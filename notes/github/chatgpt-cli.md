# ChatGPT CLI
## Summary
ChatGPT CLI is a multi-provider command-line interface for working with modern LLM APIs. It supports chat, streaming, prompts, multimodal I/O, and MCP integrations in a single toolchain. An experimental agent mode adds bounded automation with policy and budget controls.

## Key Points
- Works across OpenAI, Azure, Perplexity, LLaMA-family backends, and others.
- Provides interactive chat, thread management, and prompt-file workflows.
- Supports MCP tool calls over HTTP/STDIO with session handling.
- Includes agent modes (ReAct and Plan/Execute) with safety constraints.
- Adds image/audio features including transcription and text-to-speech.
