# claude-usage
## Summary
claude-usage is a cross-platform system tray app that monitors Claude Code usage and rate-limit status in near real time. It surfaces token consumption and reset windows without requiring a browser dashboard. The project is aimed at developers who want lightweight visibility into API burn and throttling windows.

## Key Points
- Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows with native tray/menu bar integration.
- Displays rolling usage progress bars and reset countdowns for active limits.
- Reads local Claude credentials and usage data to query or display account telemetry.
- Provides install scripts and packaging paths for each supported platform.
