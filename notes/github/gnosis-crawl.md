# Grub Crawler (gnosis-crawl)

## Summary
Grub Crawler (redirected from gnosis-crawl) is an agentic web crawler built with Python, FastAPI, and Playwright. It features "Ghost Protocol" for bypassing anti-bot protections using vision AI, autonomous browsing with an agent loop, and multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama).

## Key Points
- Ghost Protocol bypasses Cloudflare, CAPTCHAs, and JavaScript walls using vision AI
- Autonomous agent loop with planning and bounded state machine for multi-page reasoning
- API endpoints for single URL crawl, batch crawl, markdown extraction, and raw HTML
- Live browser streaming via CDP screencast over WebSocket/MJPEG
- MCP tools integration and full JSON trace per run for replayability
