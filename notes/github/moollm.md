# moollm
## Summary
MOOLLM presents itself as a filesystem-native microworld OS for LLM agents, where directories act as rooms and files act as interactive objects. It emphasizes immersive, narrative, and composable agent behavior over traditional prompt-only workflows. The repository includes a large skill system and rich world-building examples.
## Key Points
- Frames interaction as movement through a world rather than one-shot prompting.
- Documents 100+ reusable skills with an "LLM interprets skills as programs" model.
- Includes extensive example worlds, sessions, character interactions, and indexed references.
- Uses "YAML Jazz" style comments/annotations as meaningful runtime context.
- Targets exploratory agent workflows, especially in environments like Cursor.
