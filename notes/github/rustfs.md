# RustFS — High-Performance S3-Compatible Object Storage

## Summary
RustFS is a high-performance, distributed object storage system built in Rust. It claims 2.3x faster than MinIO for 4KB object payloads, offers full S3 compatibility, and is optimized for data lakes, AI, and big data workloads. Licensed under Apache 2.0 (not AGPL like MinIO).

## Key Points
- 2.3x faster than MinIO for small (4KB) object payloads
- Full S3 API compatibility with migration support from MinIO/Ceph
- Built in Rust for memory safety and performance
- Apache 2.0 licensed (permissive, unlike MinIO's AGPL)
- Distributed architecture with scalable, fault-tolerant design
