# Skipper Tool

## Summary
Skipper is a desktop interaction tool that lets AI agents like Claude Code or OpenAI Codex control web browsers through natural language commands. It uses Chrome DevTools Protocol and is designed as the "hands" of an AI agent, not the "brain."

## Key Points
- Enables AI agents to navigate URLs, click, type, and scroll in your browser
- Uses Chrome remote debugging (CDP) for browser control
- Privacy-preserving architecture — designed to run locally
- Requires Gemini API key for AI-powered interactions and OmniParser for screen parsing
- Unix philosophy: "do one thing well" — focused on being the agent's hands
