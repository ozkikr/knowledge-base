# Wispbit

## Summary
Model-agnostic AI code review tool that enforces codebase standards using custom rules. Runs anywhere (GitHub Actions, CI, MCP, Claude Code, background agents) and focuses on specific violations rather than general summaries.

## Key Points
- 100% open source and provider-agnostic
- Rule-based: uses curated rules from wispbit.com/rules or custom ones
- Opinionated output: violations with actionable feedback, no summaries or poems
- Install via `npx @wispbit/cli@latest configure`
- Specialized tool vs general-purpose code editors for review accuracy
