# Better Agents - Standards for building agents, better

## Summary
Better Agents is a CLI tool and set of standards for agent building. It supercharges coding assistants (Kilocode, Claude Code, Cursor) making them expert in any agent framework (Agno, Mastra, LangGraph). It generates a standardized project structure with scenario tests, prompt versioning, evaluations, and observability.

## Key Points
- CLI generates standardized agent project scaffolding with AGENTS.md guidelines
- Includes Scenario tests for end-to-end agent behavior validation
- Prompt versioning via YAML files for team collaboration
- Pre-configured MCP servers for framework expertise
- Evaluation notebooks for measuring prompt/pipeline performance
