# interface-design
## Summary
interface-design is a Claude Code-oriented design skill/plugin focused on consistent UI craft over time. It introduces a system file to persist design decisions across sessions so spacing, depth, and component patterns stay coherent. The project targets app and dashboard interfaces rather than marketing pages.

## Key Points
- Persists design decisions in a project-local system file for session-to-session continuity.
- Promotes principle-driven UI construction with explicit design checkpoints.
- Provides commands for initialization, status checks, audits, and pattern extraction.
- Includes direction presets for different product/interface styles.
