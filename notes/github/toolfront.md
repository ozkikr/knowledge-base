# Statespace (formerly Toolfront)

## Summary
Declarative framework for building modular LLM applications entirely in Markdown. Redirected from kruskal-labs/toolfront to statespace-tech/statespace. Lets you define tools, instructions, and data access in plain Markdown files and serve them as shareable RAG apps.

## Key Points
- Define LLM apps as pure Markdown with YAML frontmatter for tools
- CLI tools for serving locally and deploying (public or private)
- Composable pages for vector search, text-to-SQL, and agentic RAG
- Works with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex via HTTP
- Zero boilerplate — just Markdown files and CLI commands
