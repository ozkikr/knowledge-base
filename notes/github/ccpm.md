# Claude Code PM (CCPM)

## Summary
A project management system for Claude Code using spec-driven development with GitHub Issues and Git worktrees for parallel agent execution. Turns PRDs into epics, epics into issues, and issues into production code with full traceability.

## Key Points
- Spec-driven workflow: PRD → Epic Planning → Task Decomposition → GitHub Sync → Parallel Execution
- Uses GitHub Issues as the task source of truth with full traceability
- Git worktrees enable parallel agent execution without conflicts
- Core principle: "No Vibe Coding"—structured, traceable development
- Context preservation across sessions via repo-native artifacts
