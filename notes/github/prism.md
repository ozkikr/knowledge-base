# Prism

## Summary
Prism is a CLI tool that turns raw Go test output into beautiful, colorized results. It's a drop-in replacement for `go test` that makes unit test results easier to read and more pleasant to look at, with support for benchmarking visualization.

## Key Points
- Drop-in replacement for `go test` — just run `prism` instead
- Supports verbose output, failed-only filtering, and color control
- Built-in benchmark visualization with `prism bench`
- Installable via Homebrew, Go install, or GitHub releases
- Requires Go v1.24+ (uses `-json` flag)
