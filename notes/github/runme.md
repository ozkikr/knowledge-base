# Runme - DevOps Notebooks Built with Markdown

## Summary
Runme makes runbooks actually runnable by executing commands and code inside markdown fenced code blocks. It supports shell, Python, Ruby, JS/TS, and many other runtimes, retaining environment variables across execution and piping output between cells.

## Key Points
- Runs fenced code blocks directly from markdown files
- Supports multiple runtimes via shebang (shell, Python, Ruby, JS/TS, etc.)
- Environment variables retained across cell execution with output piping
- 100% compatible with existing task definitions (Makefile, Gradle, NPM, etc.)
- Install via Homebrew, NPM, or binary download
