# nao
## Summary
nao is an open-source analytics agent framework that helps data teams build context-rich agents and deploy a chat interface for business users. It combines context ingestion (data, metadata, docs, tools) with testing and evaluation workflows to improve reliability before release. The project emphasizes stack-agnostic integration and self-hosted deployment options.

## Key Points
- Provides a CLI-driven workflow (`nao init`, `nao sync`, `nao chat`, `nao test`) for creating and operating analytics agents.
- Supports broad context building from databases, repositories, metadata, and rules files.
- Includes an evaluation framework for unit-testing SQL outputs and tracking agent performance over time.
- Offers self-hosted deployment paths, including Docker and cloud deployment guidance.
- Targets both technical teams (governance, observability) and business users (natural language analytics + visualizations).
