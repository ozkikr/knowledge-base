# Claudiomiro

## Summary
Claudiomiro is an autonomous AI-powered development agent that decomposes tasks, codes, reviews, builds, tests, and commits in parallel while economizing tokens. It breaks the "AI productivity paradox" where AI tools speed up typing but slow down everything else by automating the full development cycle.

## Key Points
- Breaks tasks into smaller parallelizable subtasks executed by AI agents
- Automated code review, testing, and failure fixing
- Creates production-ready commits and pull requests
- Supports multiple AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Ollama)
- Ollama integration for up to 90% additional token cost savings
