## Summary
Arctic (arctic-cli/interface) is a terminal interface for using multiple AI coding providers through one unified workflow. It focuses on account/plan visibility, usage tracking, and switching providers without losing context. The tool emphasizes local data handling while supporting a broad set of coding-plan and API providers.
## Key Points
- Unifies multiple AI coding providers in a single terminal experience.
- Tracks usage limits and supports multiple accounts per provider.
- Imports existing Claude Code/OpenCode settings for smoother migration.
- Supports both coding-plan products and direct API-key providers.
- Provides telemetry controls with opt-out commands and local-first positioning.
