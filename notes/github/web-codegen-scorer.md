# Web Codegen Scorer

## Summary
Web Codegen Scorer is a tool from the Angular team for evaluating the quality of web code generated by LLMs. It focuses specifically on web code and uses established code quality measures rather than generic benchmarks, supporting multiple models and frameworks.

## Key Points
- Evaluate LLM-generated web code with built-in checks: build success, runtime errors, accessibility, security, best practices
- Supports multiple runners: ai-sdk, gemini-cli, claude-code, codex
- Configure evaluations with different models, frameworks, and MCP servers
- Automatic repair attempts for detected issues
- Intuitive report viewer UI for comparing results
