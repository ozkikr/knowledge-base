# Continuous Claude

## Summary
A CLI tool that runs Claude Code in a continuous loop, autonomously creating PRs, waiting for CI checks, and merging—enabling multi-step projects to complete unattended. Born from the need to go from 0% to 80%+ test coverage on a large codebase, it maintains persistent context across iterations.

## Key Points
- Runs Claude Code in a continuous loop with persistent context across iterations
- Autonomously creates PRs, waits for checks, and merges
- Inspired by CI/CD practices and persistent agents
- Solves the "one-shot" limitation of current AI coding tools
- Context from earlier iterations is preserved for later steps
