# Skrills
## Summary
Skrills is a Rust-based skills support engine for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and GitHub Copilot CLI. It validates skill definitions against each tool's requirements, syncs configurations across environments, and helps prevent configuration drift. The project also includes token analysis and an MCP server for automation workflows.
## Key Points
- Validates and auto-fixes skill metadata/frontmatter for multiple CLI ecosystems.
- Syncs skills, commands, agents, MCP servers, and preferences between Claude/Codex/Copilot setups.
- Provides token-usage analysis, dependency checks, and optimization suggestions.
- Includes a built-in MCP server with tool APIs for validation, sync, and generation tasks.
