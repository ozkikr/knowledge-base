# codex-mcp-go

## Summary
A Go-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that wraps OpenAI's Codex CLI, enabling AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Roo Code, and KiloCode to delegate coding tasks to Codex. Designed for "let the specialist handle it" workflows.

## Key Points
- Bridges Codex CLI to any MCP-compatible AI client
- Session management with SESSION_ID for multi-turn conversations
- Sandbox control with read-only and workspace-write security policies
- Single binary deployment, no runtime dependencies
- Installable via npx or manual binary download
