# SWE-agent

## Summary
An autonomous coding agent that takes GitHub issues and attempts to fix them automatically using LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet). State of the art on SWE-bench among open-source projects. Built by Princeton and Stanford researchers, published at NeurIPS 2024.

## Key Points
- Autonomously fixes GitHub issues using LLMs with tool use
- State of the art on SWE-bench (open-source); also usable for cybersecurity and competitive coding
- Configurable via single YAML file; designed for research (simple & hackable)
- Mini-SWE-agent successor achieves 65% on SWE-bench verified in ~100 lines of Python
- Free-flowing design leaving maximal agency to the LM
