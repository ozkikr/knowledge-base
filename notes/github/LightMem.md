# LightMem

## Summary
LightMem is a lightweight and efficient memory-augmented generation framework published at ICLR 2026. It provides a comprehensive baseline evaluation framework supporting memory layers like Mem0, A-MEM, and LangMem on benchmarks like LoCoMo and LongMemEval.

## Key Points
- ICLR 2026 paper on lightweight memory-augmented generation for LLMs
- Benchmarks memory systems (Mem0, A-MEM, LangMem) on LoCoMo and LongMemEval
- Includes tutorial notebooks for travel planning, code assistant, and evaluation use cases
- Roadmap includes KV cache pre-computation, multi-modal memory, and more model integrations
- Supports coordinated use of context and long-term memory storage
