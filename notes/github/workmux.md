# workmux — Git Worktrees + tmux for Parallel Dev

## Summary
workmux is an opinionated workflow tool for managing git worktrees and tmux windows as isolated development environments. Perfect for running multiple AI agents in parallel without conflict, with support for kitty and WezTerm backends.

## Key Points
- Create git worktrees with matching tmux windows in a single command
- Merge branches and clean up everything (worktree, window, branches) in one command
- Dashboard for monitoring agents, reviewing changes, and sending commands
- /worktree slash command for delegating tasks from Claude Code
- Agent status tracking displayed in tmux window names
