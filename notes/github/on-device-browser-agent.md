# Local Browser - On-Device AI Web Automation
## Summary
This project is a Chrome extension for on-device AI browser automation using WebLLM and WebGPU. It executes planning and navigation steps locally, aiming for private, API-key-free task automation in the browser.

## Key Points
- Runs LLM inference locally in-browser via WebLLM.
- Uses a planner + navigator multi-agent pattern for task execution.
- Automates DOM interactions such as click, type, and extract.
- Designed for privacy-first usage with no cloud inference dependency.
- Supports offline operation after initial model download.
