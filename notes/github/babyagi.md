# BabyAGI - Self-Building Autonomous Agent Framework

## Summary
BabyAGI is an experimental framework for self-building autonomous agents by Yohei Nakajima. Originally introduced task planning for autonomous agents in March 2023, it has evolved into a function framework (functionz) that stores, manages, and executes functions from a database with graph-based dependency tracking.

## Key Points
- Pioneered task planning as a method for autonomous agent development (March 2023)
- Core is "functionz" — a database-backed function framework with graph-based dependency tracking
- Includes dashboard for managing functions, running updates, and viewing logs
- Automatic function loading with import and secret management
- Experimental/educational — not intended for production use
