# Strix - Open-Source AI Security Testing Agents

## Summary
Strix provides autonomous AI agents that act like real hackers—running code dynamically, finding vulnerabilities, and validating them with proof-of-concepts. Built for developers and security teams who need fast, accurate security testing without manual pentesting overhead.

## Key Points
- AI agents that dynamically run code and validate vulnerabilities with real PoCs
- Full hacker toolkit: HTTP proxy, browser automation, terminal environments
- CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions to block insecure code on PRs
- Auto-fix and reporting for accelerated remediation
- Supports local LLMs or cloud providers (OpenAI, etc.)
