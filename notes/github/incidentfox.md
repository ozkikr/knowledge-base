# IncidentFox

## Summary
IncidentFox is an AI-assisted SRE platform focused on automating incident investigation and root-cause analysis. It connects to observability, infrastructure, and collaboration systems to gather evidence and reason through hypotheses. The workflow is designed to keep responders in familiar channels like Slack while reducing manual correlation work.

## Key Points
- Automates data collection across logs, metrics, incidents, and infrastructure integrations.
- Positions itself as Slack-first with support for web, GitHub, PagerDuty, and API entry points.
- Emphasizes context learning from codebases, past incidents, and team knowledge.
- Offers open-source self-hosting and deployment paths for different privacy/control needs.
- Targets on-call efficiency improvements through alert correlation and dependency analysis.
