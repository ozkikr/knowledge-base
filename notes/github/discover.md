# TTT-Discover
## Summary
TTT-Discover explores reinforcement learning at test time so models can continue improving on the task they are actively solving. The project reports strong results across domains including math discovery, kernel optimization, algorithmic contests, and biology benchmarks. It is the reference implementation for the "Learning to Discover at Test Time" work.

## Key Points
- Applies online/test-time RL loops to improve output quality on task-specific problem instances.
- Benchmarks across multiple domains, not only traditional language tasks.
- Includes SLURM-oriented launch pathways and task-specific dependency profiles.
- Provides scripts and docs for running experiments and extending to new tasks.
- Linked directly to the accompanying paper and project page.
