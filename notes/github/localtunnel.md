# localtunnel
## Summary
localtunnel exposes a local development port to a public URL for sharing and callback testing. It is commonly used for webhook development and external QA without deployment steps. The project includes both a CLI and programmatic API.

## Key Points
- Publishes localhost services through temporary public endpoints.
- Supports custom subdomains and configurable upstream tunnel hosts.
- Works as a global CLI tool (`lt`) or as a Node dependency.
- Useful for integrations like Twilio callbacks and remote browser testing.
