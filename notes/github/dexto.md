# Dexto

## Summary
An open agent harness for AI applications that ships with a powerful coding agent. Acts as an orchestration layer turning LLMs into reliable, stateful agents with tools, memory, and error recovery — like an OS for AI agents.

## Key Points
- Configuration-driven: define agents in YAML, swap models without code changes
- Batteries included: session management, tool orchestration, memory, observability
- Runs anywhere: CLI, Web UI, REST API, Discord, Telegram, or embedded
- Supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients and servers
- Can build coding agents, autonomous agents, multi-agent systems
