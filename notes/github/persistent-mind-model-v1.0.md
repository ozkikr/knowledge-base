# persistent-mind-model-v1.0
## Summary
persistent-mind-model-v1.0 proposes a deterministic, event-sourced architecture for persistent AI memory and identity continuity. The repository frames identity as replayable state derived from a ledger rather than model-specific weights. It includes a draft white paper and evidence artifacts aimed at cross-model verification.
## Key Points
- Defines AI memory/identity as an immutable event-sourced ledger.
- Emphasizes deterministic replay and model-agnostic continuity claims.
- Includes white-paper-style documentation and proof artifacts.
- Focuses on verifiability via telemetry logs and transcript evidence.
- Positions itself as an architecture for persistent cognitive state.
