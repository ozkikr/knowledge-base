# yepanywhere
## Summary
yepanywhere is a self-hosted web interface for supervising Claude and Codex CLI sessions from desktop or mobile. It layers file upload, push approvals, and multi-session visibility on top of existing local CLI history without requiring a cloud account or database.
## Key Points
- Provides remote/mobile oversight for long-running local agent sessions.
- Supports push notifications for approval workflows and status checks.
- Includes multi-session dashboard features (star/archive/observe).
- Keeps architecture lightweight with local-state and self-hosted deployment.
