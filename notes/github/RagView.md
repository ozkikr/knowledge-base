# RagView

## Summary
A unified evaluation and benchmarking platform for comparing different RAG methods on your specific data. Addresses the lack of standardized tools for comparing ~60 distinct RAG approaches across metrics like accuracy, cost, and latency.

## Key Points
- Benchmarks diverse RAG solutions with standardized evaluation metrics
- Measures answer accuracy, context precision/recall, cost, and latency
- Modular plug-in architecture for adding new RAG approaches
- Currently supports PDF documents with plans for more formats
- Provides intuitive visualization tools for comparison
