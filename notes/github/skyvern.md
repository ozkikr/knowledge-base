# Skyvern - Automate Browser Workflows with AI

## Summary
Skyvern automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a Playwright-compatible SDK with AI functionality and a no-code workflow builder, replacing brittle XPath/DOM-based automation with vision-based interaction that works on unseen websites and resists layout changes.

## Key Points
- Uses Vision LLMs instead of XPath/DOM selectors for website interaction
- Works on never-before-seen websites by mapping visual elements to actions
- Resistant to website layout changes — no pre-determined selectors
- Playwright-compatible SDK plus no-code workflow builder
- Inspired by BabyAGI and AutoGPT's task-driven autonomous agent design
