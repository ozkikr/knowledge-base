# Claude IPC MCP

## Summary
An AI-to-AI communication protocol that lets different AI assistants (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) send persistent messages to each other across platforms and sessions. Think of it as email for AIs — simple, reliable, and persistent.

## Key Points
- Natural language commands — no coding required to use
- Persistent messages that survive restarts
- Cross-platform: works between Claude Code, Gemini, ChatGPT, and any Python-capable assistant
- Simple setup: install once, use everywhere
- Optional authentication/security layer
