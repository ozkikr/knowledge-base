# BubblyUI - Vue-Inspired TUI Framework for Go

## Summary
BubblyUI is a Vue-inspired terminal UI framework for Go built on Bubbletea. It provides type-safe reactivity with Go generics, a component-based architecture with 30+ built-in components, and familiar patterns from Vue.js including lifecycle hooks and a composition API.

## Key Points
- Type-safe reactivity with Ref[T], Computed[T], and Watch using Go generics
- 30+ built-in components (buttons, inputs, tabs, modals, tables, etc.)
- Vue-style lifecycle hooks: onMounted, onUpdated, onUnmounted, etc.
- Zero-boilerplate launch with bubbly.Run() (69-82% less code for async apps)
- Lipgloss integration for styling, conditional rendering, and data binding directives
