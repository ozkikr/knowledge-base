# Apptron

## Summary
A local-first development platform that runs a full Linux environment (Alpine) in the browser using v86 x86 emulation via Wanix. Features a VSCode-based editor and supports native Wasm executables, functioning like a modern Smalltalk environment.

## Key Points
- Runs entirely in the browser—no cloud dependency
- Full Alpine Linux with custom kernel via v86 JIT emulator
- First-class Go language support, extensible to other languages
- Environments work like Docker images with persistence via IndexedDB or OPFS
- Endorsed by ibuildthecloud and simonw for its ambitious scope
