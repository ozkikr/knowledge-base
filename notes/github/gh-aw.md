# gh-aw - GitHub Agentic Workflows

## Summary
A GitHub CLI extension that lets you write agentic workflows in natural language markdown and run them in GitHub Actions. Built by GitHub, it enables AI-powered automation of repository tasks with multiple security layers.

## Key Points
- Write workflows in natural language markdown, executed in GitHub Actions
- Read-only by default; write operations only through sanitized safe-outputs
- Sandboxed execution with network isolation and supply chain security (SHA-pinned deps)
- Human approval gates for critical operations
- Tool allow-listing and compile-time validation for safety
