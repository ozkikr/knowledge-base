# obsidian-agent-client
## Summary
Agent Client Plugin for Obsidian brings terminal AI agents like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI directly into an Obsidian vault. It is built on Agent Client Protocol (ACP) and adds chat-native workflows for knowledge work. The project focuses on practical daily usage with multi-session support and note-aware interactions.
## Key Points
- Integrates multiple agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and custom agents) inside Obsidian.
- Supports note mentions, image attachments, slash commands, and session history.
- Can export chats to Markdown and lets agents execute terminal commands through the plugin.
- Installation paths include BRAT and manual release-based setup.
- Includes dedicated setup guides for each supported agent backend.
