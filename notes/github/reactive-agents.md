# reactive-agents
## Summary
Reactive Agents is an OpenAI-compatible proxy platform that continuously improves agent behavior based on observed performance. It tunes prompts and model parameters automatically so existing applications can gain optimization without major integration changes.
## Key Points
- Works as a drop-in API endpoint replacement for OpenAI-style clients.
- Tracks outcomes and iteratively optimizes prompts and hyperparameters.
- Supports multiple model providers behind one interface.
- Includes agent/skill abstractions and evaluation-driven improvement loops.
