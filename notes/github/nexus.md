# Nexus
## Summary
Nexus is a terminal-based API client for testing and managing REST and gRPC requests. It provides a keyboard-driven TUI workflow with persistent local storage so request collections survive between sessions. The tool also supports importing Postman collections and exporting to JSON or curl.
## Key Points
- Rust TUI client for API development and testing in the terminal.
- Organizes requests into collections with persistent storage via sled.
- Supports full request editing (headers, query params, auth, body).
- Includes Postman v2.1 import and export features.
- Optimized for keyboard-first usage with Vim-style navigation.
