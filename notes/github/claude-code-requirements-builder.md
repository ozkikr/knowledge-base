# Claude Code Requirements Builder

## Summary
An intelligent requirements gathering system for Claude Code that progressively builds context through automated discovery, asks simple yes/no questions, and generates comprehensive requirements documentation with specific file paths and patterns.

## Key Points
- Two-phase questioning: 5 high-level context questions, then 5 expert questions after code analysis
- All questions are yes/no with smart defaults — say "idk" to use defaults
- Codebase-aware: AI analyzes code first, then asks informed questions
- Generates comprehensive specs with specific file paths and patterns
- Custom slash commands: /requirements-start, /requirements-status, /requirements-end, etc.
