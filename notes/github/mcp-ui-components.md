# MCP UI by Flowbite
## Summary
MCP UI by Flowbite is an open-source component and widget library for building MCP apps that run across clients like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, and Windsurf. It combines Flowbite UI primitives with Skybridge-based app architecture. The repo provides both reusable components and integration guidance for many host environments.

## Key Points
- Includes ready-to-use MCP UI patterns such as text blocks, selection inputs, charts, tables, QR, and ecommerce widgets.
- Uses an Express + Vite local stack with an `/mcp` endpoint and widget HMR development loop.
- Documents connector setup for many clients (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini CLI, Cursor, VS Code, Codex, etc.).
- Supports customization through Flowbite theming and Tailwind-based styling.
- Serves as a practical starter for multi-client MCP interface development.
