# peky

## Summary
peky is a TUI for organizing multiple terminal-based AI coding agents in one workspace. It targets developers juggling parallel sessions across projects by providing reusable layouts and persistent daemon-backed sessions. The tool blends pane management, command routing, and project-level configuration for team workflows.

## Key Points
- Runs multiple agents side-by-side with broadcast and quick interaction patterns.
- Uses a persistent daemon so sessions continue after the UI closes.
- Supports project-local .peky.yml configs that teams can commit and share.
- Includes mouse support, scrollback/copy mode, and command palette actions.
- Aims to reduce setup friction for multi-agent coding workflows.
