# hector
## Summary
hector is presented as an A2A-native AI agent platform written in Go. The repository currently indicates it is in a private/resharpening phase, but still signals a focus on agent-platform infrastructure.
## Key Points
- Framed as an A2A-oriented foundation for agent interoperability.
- Positioned as a Go-based platform rather than a narrow single-agent app.
- Current public README notes temporary private status for rework.
- Useful to watch for future architecture and protocol implementation updates.
