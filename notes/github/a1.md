# A1 - The Agent-to-Code Compiler

## Summary
A1 is an agent compiler framework from Stanford that compiles agents (sets of tools and descriptions) either ahead-of-time into tools or just-in-time for execution. It optimizes for speed (up to 10x faster), safety (minimizes LLM data exposure), and determinism by replacing LLM calls with code where possible.

## Key Points
- Compiles agents AOT into tools or JIT for optimized execution per input
- Up to 10x faster than traditional agent frameworks
- Minimizes non-deterministic LLM calls ("determinism-maxing")
- Supports tools from OpenAPI, MCP servers, databases, fsspec, Python functions
- Type-safe with engineer-defined Verify functions for constraints
