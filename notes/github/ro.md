# ro - Streams & Reactive Programming for Go

## Summary
A Go implementation of the ReactiveX spec by samber, providing a declarative and composable API for handling streams of data and events in event-driven applications. Built on Go 1.18+ generics, complementing samber's lo (sync helpers), do (dependency injection), and mo (monads) libraries.

## Key Points
- Go implementation of ReactiveX with Observable, Observer, and Operator patterns
- Built on Go 1.18+ generics for type safety
- Handles infinite async data streams (vs lo's finite synchronous sequences)
- Part of samber's Go generics ecosystem (lo, do, mo, ro)
- Declarative, composable API for event-driven applications
