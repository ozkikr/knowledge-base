# LangWatch

## Summary
LangWatch is a platform for LLM evaluations and AI agent testing. It helps teams test, simulate, evaluate, and monitor LLM-powered agents end-to-end—before release and in production. Built on OpenTelemetry/OTLP standards for framework- and provider-agnostic observability.

## Key Points
- End-to-end agent simulations with user simulator and judge
- Unified loop: trace → dataset → evaluate → optimize prompts → re-test
- OpenTelemetry/OTLP-native, no vendor lock-in
- Collaborative features for team-based evaluation workflows
- Supports both offline evaluation and production monitoring
