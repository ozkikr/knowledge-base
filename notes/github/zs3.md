# zs3
## Summary
zs3 is a compact S3-compatible object storage server written in Zig with zero dependencies. It emphasizes minimal footprint while still implementing core S3 operations and optional distributed behavior.
## Key Points
- Implements key S3 operations with SigV4 authentication compatibility.
- Maintains a very small codebase and binary size compared to typical alternatives.
- Supports multipart uploads and range requests for practical client compatibility.
- Offers an optional distributed/content-addressed mode for networked storage.
