# syntux
## Summary
syntux is a generative UI library for web apps that creates interface layouts from provided values and hints. It targets React/Next.js workflows and uses model calls to produce a structured UI schema that can be streamed, cached, and reused.

## Key Points
- Generates UI from arbitrary object/array/primitive inputs.
- Supports streaming generation for progressive rendering experiences.
- Allows custom components and custom server-side actions.
- Integrates with Vercel AI SDK provider ecosystem.
- Includes caching patterns to reuse generated interfaces with new values.
