# Atomic Agents

## Summary
An extremely lightweight and modular framework for building agentic AI pipelines based on the concept of atomicity. Built on Instructor and Pydantic, each component is single-purpose, reusable, composable, and predictable — like LEGO blocks for AI.

## Key Points
- Atomic design: each agent, tool, and context provider does one thing well
- Built on Instructor and Pydantic for structured, type-safe outputs
- Components are reusable across multiple pipelines
- Context providers for dynamic agent behavior
- Schema chaining for connecting agents together
