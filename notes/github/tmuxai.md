# TmuxAI

## Summary
TmuxAI is an AI-powered terminal assistant that lives inside tmux sessions. It observes and understands the content of your tmux panes, providing context-aware assistance without interrupting your workflow — like a pair programmer watching your terminal.

## Key Points
- Non-intrusive: observes tmux panes and understands context across multiple panes
- Multiple modes: Observe, Prepare, and Watch modes for different interaction styles
- Supports knowledge bases for domain-specific assistance
- Multi-model configuration with easy switching between LLM providers
- Features conversation squashing to manage context length
