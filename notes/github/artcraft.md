# ArtCraft
## Summary
ArtCraft presents itself as an IDE for interactive AI image and video creation. It emphasizes controlled generation workflows such as compositing, scene consistency, and spatial authoring rather than prompt-only iteration. The project is open-source and aimed at artists, designers, and filmmakers.

## Key Points
- Focuses on "crafting" workflows with stronger control than simple text-to-image prompting.
- Highlights compositing and scene construction features for repeatability and visual consistency.
- Targets creative production use cases across still-image and video generation.
- Maintains an open repository with community and social channels for feedback.
- Frames itself as a broad creative platform rather than a single-model demo.
