# Jujutsu (jj)

## Summary
Jujutsu is a Git-compatible version control system designed to be both simple and powerful. It uses Git repositories as storage backend while adding features inspired by Mercurial/Sapling (revsets, anonymous branches, no staging area). Abstracts VCS algorithms from storage systems.

## Key Points
- Git-compatible: uses Git repos for physical storage
- Revset language for selecting commits (Mercurial-inspired)
- No explicit index or staging area
- Anonymous branches — no need to name every change
- Designed for both solo and large-scale team use
