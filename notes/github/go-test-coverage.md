# go-test-coverage

## Summary
go-test-coverage is a Go tool that reports issues when test coverage falls below a specified threshold, helping maintain code quality and prevent coverage regressions. It's serverless, privacy-focused (all checks local), and works both locally and in CI pipelines.

## Key Points
- Quick 5-minute setup with no external server dependencies
- All coverage checks run locally — no data sent to third parties
- Lightning-fast execution (~1 second)
- Works both locally and in CI pipelines
- Configurable coverage thresholds to prevent regressions
