# myclaude
## Summary
myclaude is a multi-agent workflow system for Claude Code that can orchestrate Codex, Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode backends. It ships installable modules/skills for feature development, debugging, requirements work, and agile-style agent collaboration. The project is focused on modular command-driven automation for coding teams.
## Key Points
- Provides module-based commands like do, omo, bmad, requirements, and sparv.
- Supports a wrapper architecture where Claude plans and backend CLIs execute tasks.
- Includes installer/update flows and module toggles via configuration.
- Combines standalone skills (browser, codex, gemini, testing, PRD generation) with orchestration workflows.
