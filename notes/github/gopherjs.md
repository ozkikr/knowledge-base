# GopherJS
## Summary
GopherJS is a compiler that translates Go code into JavaScript so Go programs can run in browsers and JS environments. It supports a broad subset of Go features and integrates with common development commands like build, test, and serve. The project enables Go-first frontend development without abandoning web runtime compatibility.

## Key Points
- Compiles Go code to JavaScript for browser-based and JS runtime execution.
- Supports modules, modern Go features, and front-end development workflows.
- Provides dev commands such as gopherjs serve for iterative local testing.
- Documents compatibility constraints and environment requirements by Go version.
- Backed by community docs, playground, and contribution pathways.
