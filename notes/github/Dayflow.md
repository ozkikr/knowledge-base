# Dayflow - Automatic Day Timeline Generator

## Summary
Dayflow is a native macOS app built with SwiftUI that watches your screen, analyzes it with AI, and generates a private timeline of your activities. It's lightweight (~25MB, <1% CPU) and supports multiple AI providers including Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, ChatGPT, and Claude.

## Key Points
- Understands context beyond app usage (e.g., "researching on YouTube" vs "watching cat videos")
- Privacy-focused: nothing leaves your Mac; you choose your AI provider
- Supports Gemini (API key), local models (Ollama/LM Studio), or ChatGPT/Claude
- Lightweight: ~100MB RAM, <1% CPU usage
- macOS 13+ required
