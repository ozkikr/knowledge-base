# symbolic-circuit-distillation
## Summary
This repository explores symbolic circuit distillation for mechanistic interpretability. The goal is to transform pruned neural circuits into concise, executable, human-readable programs with formal verification steps.

## Key Points
- Targets algorithm extraction from sparse or pruned transformer circuits.
- Combines surrogate modeling, DSL synthesis, and SMT-based checks.
- Focuses on bounded correctness guarantees for distilled programs.
- Useful for interpretability researchers studying circuit-level behavior.
