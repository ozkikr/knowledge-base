# Claudish

## Summary
Claudish is a CLI tool that lets you run Claude Code with any AI model by proxying requests through a local Anthropic API-compatible server. It supports 580+ models via OpenRouter plus direct providers like Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, and more.

## Key Points
- Use existing AI subscriptions (Gemini Advanced, ChatGPT Plus, etc.) with Claude Code
- Supports cloud providers (OpenRouter, Gemini, OpenAI, Kimi, GLM) and local models (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM)
- Routing syntax: `provider@model[:concurrency]` for explicit model selection
- 100% offline option via local models — code never leaves your machine
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) — no additional subscription fees
