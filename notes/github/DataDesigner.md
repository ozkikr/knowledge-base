# NeMo Data Designer

## Summary
NeMo Data Designer is an NVIDIA library for generating high-quality synthetic datasets from scratch or using seed data. It goes beyond simple LLM prompting by supporting statistical samplers, dependency-aware generation, and built-in validation.

## Key Points
- Generate diverse data using statistical samplers, LLMs, or existing seed datasets
- Control relationships between fields with dependency-aware generation
- Built-in validators (Python, SQL, custom) and LLM-as-a-judge scoring
- Preview mode for quick iteration before full-scale generation
- Supports NVIDIA Build API, OpenAI, and OpenRouter as model providers
