# mviz
## Summary
mviz is a Claude-oriented visualization skill that turns compact JSON/Markdown specs into polished static reports. It is designed for ad hoc analysis where fast iteration and lightweight artifacts matter more than dashboard infrastructure. Output targets include shareable HTML and printable PDF.

## Key Points
- Converts concise chart specs into ECharts-based report layouts.
- Supports many chart/component types and a grid-based report format.
- Encourages iterative query → visualize → refine analyst workflows.
- Integrates well with MCP-connected SQL exploration patterns.
