# Fara-7B

## Summary
Microsoft's first agentic small language model (7B parameters) designed specifically for computer use. Operates visually by perceiving webpages and taking actions like scrolling, typing, and clicking on predicted coordinates, achieving state-of-the-art performance in its size class.

## Key Points
- Only 7B parameters — enables on-device deployment for reduced latency and privacy
- Operates visually without accessibility trees or separate parsing models
- Averages ~16 steps per task vs ~41 for comparable models
- Integrates with Magentic-UI for a visual interface
- Served via vLLM with CLI and UI interfaces
