# ROMA - Recursive Open Meta-Agents

## Summary
ROMA is a meta-agent framework that uses recursive hierarchical structures to solve complex problems. It breaks tasks into parallelizable components through a recursive plan-execute loop with modules for atomizing, planning, executing, aggregating, and verifying.

## Key Points
- Recursive plan-execute loop: Atomizer → Planner → Executor → Aggregator → Verifier
- Parallel problem solving with agents working simultaneously on sub-tasks
- Transparent development with clear structure for easy debugging
- REST API and CLI for interaction
- Extensible with custom toolkits and modules
