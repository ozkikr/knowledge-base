# webctl
## Summary
webctl is a command-line browser automation system designed for both human operators and AI agents. It favors CLI-driven filtering and scripting to reduce context bloat compared to always-on MCP payloads. The project includes daemonized sessions, semantic element targeting, and integrations for multiple coding assistants.
## Key Points
- Exposes browser actions through CLI commands with persistent session profiles.
- Uses role-based element queries and structured snapshots for robust automation.
- Provides agent setup tooling that generates skills/prompts per client ecosystem.
- Includes IPC authentication and deployment options for local or containerized use.
