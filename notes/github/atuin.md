# Atuin

## Summary
Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, recording additional context (exit code, duration, cwd, hostname). It provides a full-screen search UI and optional fully encrypted sync between machines.

## Key Points
- Replaces shell history with SQLite database, records exit code, cwd, duration, hostname
- Full-screen history search UI bound to ctrl-r and up arrow
- Optional end-to-end encrypted sync across machines via Atuin server (self-hostable)
- Supports zsh, bash, fish, nushell, xonsh, and PowerShell
- Filter by session, directory, or global; search by exit code, time, and more
