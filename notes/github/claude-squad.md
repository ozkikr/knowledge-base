# Claude Squad

## Summary
A terminal app that manages multiple Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Aider instances in separate workspaces. Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, allowing simultaneous work with background auto-accept mode and change review before applying.

## Key Points
- Manage multiple AI agent instances in one terminal window via tmux
- Each task gets an isolated git workspace—no conflicts
- Auto-accept (yolo) mode for background task completion
- Review changes before applying; checkout before pushing
- Supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Aider, and other local agents
