# Swama

## Summary
Swama is a high-performance machine learning runtime written in pure Swift for macOS, built on Apple's MLX framework. It provides local LLM and VLM inference with an OpenAI-compatible API, menu bar app, CLI tools, multimodal support, and local audio transcription via Whisper.

## Key Points
- Pure Swift, optimized for Apple Silicon (M1-M4) on macOS 15+
- OpenAI-compatible API endpoints (chat, embeddings, transcription, TTS)
- Modular architecture: SwamaKit core library, CLI tool, and menu bar app
- Supports multimodal inputs (text + image), streaming, and HuggingFace model downloads
- Built-in Whisper-based local audio transcription
