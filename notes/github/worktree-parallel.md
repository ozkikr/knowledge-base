# worktree-parallel
## Summary
worktree-parallel is a lightweight Codex skill that standardizes creating a second git worktree for parallel feature development. It guides branch naming, worktree path conventions, and editor launch steps so a second coding session can start quickly. The skill is aimed at reducing friction when splitting work across concurrent branches.
## Key Points
- Defines a practical workflow for creating new or existing-branch worktrees.
- Includes safety guidance to avoid forceful operations and accidental cleanup.
- Supports opening the new workspace directly in code/Cursor via CLI.
- Encourages immediate handoff into a parallel Codex session in the new worktree.
