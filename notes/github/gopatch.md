# gopatch: Refactoring and Code Transformation Tool for Go

## Summary
gopatch is a tool from Uber that matches and transforms Go code using patch files, similar to the Unix patch tool but with Go syntax awareness. It enables automated refactoring and restyling using metavariables, elision, and pattern matching.

## Key Points
- Syntax-aware code transformation (understands Go AST, not plain text)
- Patch file format with metavariables for flexible matching
- Supports statements, elision, and description comments
- Diff mode for previewing changes
- Built by Uber's Go team
