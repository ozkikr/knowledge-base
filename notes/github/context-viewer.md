# Context Viewer

## Summary
An observability tool for LLM context windows. Given a conversation log, it breaks down components and their sizes, classifies messages into categories, and visualizes context composition. Runs client-side with no backend — your data stays private.

## Key Points
- Breaks conversation context into meaningful segments with size analysis
- LLM-powered classification of message categories
- No server component — runs entirely in browser for privacy
- Uses Vercel AI SDK; currently supports OpenAI, designed to be provider-agnostic
- Supports completions and responses API formats
