# Lynkr
## Summary
Lynkr is a self-hosted HTTP proxy that lets coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex run against many model providers through a unified interface. It focuses on compatibility, cost optimization, and flexible deployment for local or remote usage.
## Key Points
- Provides a drop-in backend for Claude Code and OpenAI-compatible tooling.
- Supports cloud and local providers (e.g., Bedrock, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio).
- Includes optimization features such as caching and token/cost reduction workflows.
- Can be deployed locally for privacy-focused setups or on remote hosts for team use.
