# Claudetainer

## Summary
Claudetainer provides auto-configured Claude Code devcontainer workflows with a mobile-friendly shell. It runs Claude Code in an isolated devcontainer with persistent shell sessions, hooks, slash commands, and specialized sub-agents designed for coding without a keyboard.

## Key Points
- Instant setup with language auto-detection (Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, Shell)
- SSH + terminal multiplexer for mobile coding (even from iPhone)
- Specialized sub-agents and automatic quality control
- Install via Homebrew, init with language preset, connect via SSH
- Uses Anthropic's official devcontainer image
