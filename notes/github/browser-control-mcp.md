# Browser Control MCP

## Summary
An MCP server paired with a Firefox browser extension that gives AI assistants access to tab management, browsing history, and webpage content. Designed to be more secure than full web automation by restricting page modification and requiring explicit user consent per domain.

## Key Points
- Supports tab management (open, close, group, reorder), history search, and webpage text reading
- Security-first: no page modification, no arbitrary scripting, domain-level user consent required
- Local-only connection with shared secret between MCP server and extension
- Extension-side audit log and tool enable/disable configuration
- Available as Firefox add-on with Claude Desktop DXT integration
