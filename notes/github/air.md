# Air

## Summary
Air is a live-reloading command-line utility for developing Go applications. It watches for file changes and automatically rebuilds and restarts your Go app. Born from the desire for a more flexible alternative to "fresh" when developing with the Gin framework.

## Key Points
- Live reload for Go apps — watches files and rebuilds automatically
- Colorful log output and customizable build commands
- Supports excluding subdirectories and watching new directories
- Automatic .env file loading
- Installable via `go install` or brew
