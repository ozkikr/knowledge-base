# Claude on the Go

## Summary
A WebSocket bridge that lets you control your Mac's Claude CLI from your phone. Supports local WiFi access via QR code scanning and remote access via VPN (Tailscale/ZeroTier) or SSH, keeping everything on your local network for privacy.

## Key Points
- WebSocket bridge between mobile devices and Mac-hosted Claude CLI
- Local WiFi access with QR code or remote via VPN/SSH
- No cloud sync — all traffic stays on local network
- Works on iPhone, Android, or any browser
- SSH terminal option for direct CLI access (recommended for power users)
