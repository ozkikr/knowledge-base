# Agent OS

## Summary
A system for injecting codebase standards and writing better specs for spec-driven development. Works alongside Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, and other AI tools to keep agents aligned with your coding conventions.

## Key Points
- Discover standards: extract patterns and conventions from your codebase
- Deploy standards: intelligently inject relevant standards based on context
- Shape spec: create better plans that lead to better builds
- Language and framework agnostic
- Created by Brian Casel at Builder Methods
