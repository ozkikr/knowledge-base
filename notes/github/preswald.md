# Preswald

## Summary
Preswald is a WASM packager for Python-based interactive data apps. It bundles compute, data access, and UI into self-contained HTML files that run entirely in-browser using Pyodide and DuckDB, requiring no server or installation.

## Key Points
- Exports Python data apps as single static HTML files that run offline
- Built on Pyodide + DuckDB for in-browser computation
- Reactive engine powered by a DAG of dependencies
- Built-in UI components (tables, charts, forms)
- AI-ready: apps are fully inspectable and modifiable by agents
