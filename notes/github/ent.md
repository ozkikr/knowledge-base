# ent - An Entity Framework for Go

## Summary
ent is a powerful entity framework for Go that makes it easy to build and maintain applications with large data models. Inspired by Meta's internal Ent framework, it uses schema-as-code, generates statically typed APIs, and supports multiple database drivers including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.

## Key Points
- Schema as Code: model database schemas as Go objects
- 100% statically typed and explicit API via code generation
- Supports MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, SQLite, and Gremlin
- Easy graph traversal for queries, aggregations, and graph structures
- Extensible via Go templates; developed by the Atlas team
