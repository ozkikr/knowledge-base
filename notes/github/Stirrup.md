# Stirrup

## Summary
Stirrup is a lightweight agent framework from Artificial Analysis that works with the model rather than imposing rigid workflows (inspired by Claude Code). It includes built-in tools for code execution, web browsing, MCP client support, and context management.

- Analyzed Claude Code, Codex to incorporate best practices
- Built-in code execution (local, Docker, E2B), web search, MCP client
- Automatic context summarization when approaching limits
- Skills system for modular domain-specific instructions
- Also available as TypeScript (StirrupJS)
