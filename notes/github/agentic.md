# agentic
## Summary
agentic is a minimalist Go workspace exploring advanced RAG approaches, especially Microsoft's GraphRAG and dsRAG-style ideas. It is positioned as a practical experimentation repo rather than a polished framework.
## Key Points
- Focuses on implementing and testing GraphRAG techniques in Go.
- Documents critical observations about summarization quality tradeoffs.
- Plans dsRAG-inspired methods like semantic sectioning and RSE.
- Useful as a research sandbox for retrieval architecture comparisons.
