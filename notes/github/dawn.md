# Dawn

## Summary
A lightweight, distraction-free writing environment that runs in the terminal with live markdown rendering. Headers scale up, math becomes Unicode art, and images appear inline — no Electron, no browser, no network required.

## Key Points
- Live markdown rendering as you type (headers, bold, code highlighting, tables)
- Portable architecture: core engine separated from platform layer via platform.h
- Targets: POSIX terminals (with Kitty graphics) and web (experimental via Emscripten)
- Supports footnotes, emoji shortcodes, smart typography, task lists
- Written in C for minimal overhead
