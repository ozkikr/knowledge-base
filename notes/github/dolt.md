# Dolt
## Summary
Dolt is a SQL database that brings Git-like version control semantics to tabular data. Teams can branch, merge, diff, and collaborate on databases using familiar Git workflows and SQL-native versioning features. It can run as a MySQL-compatible server and be used through both SQL and CLI interfaces.

## Key Points
- Combines database operations with Git-style commits, branches, merges, and history.
- Provides a MySQL-compatible server plus a Git-like CLI for data workflows.
- Supports data collaboration patterns such as replication and team-based branching.
- Backed by an ecosystem including DoltHub, DoltLab, and Hosted Dolt services.
- Installable via release binaries, Homebrew, package managers, and source builds.
