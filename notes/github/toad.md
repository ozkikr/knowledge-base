# Toad

## Summary
Toad is a unified terminal interface for AI coding agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex, OpenHand, etc.) by Will McGugan. It blends a traditional shell workflow with agentic AI through an intuitive TUI, featuring a fully integrated shell with persistent state.

## Key Points
- AI "App Store" — discover, install, and run dozens of agents from the UI
- Supports Agent Client Protocol (ACP) for third-party agent integration
- Fully integrated shell with persistent directory/env changes, color output, and tab completion
- Only terminal agent UI that interleaves real shell sessions with AI prompts
- Created by Will McGugan (author of Rich/Textual)
