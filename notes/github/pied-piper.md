# pied-piper
## Summary
Pied Piper organizes teams of AI subagents to execute long-running software tasks with tracking and approval gates. It is built for autonomous or semi-autonomous workflows across CLI agents, Docker, and remote environments. The system uses playbooks and role definitions to standardize repeatable SDLC processes.
## Key Points
- Coordinates multiple subagents for complex development tasks.
- Supports human-in-the-loop approvals and end-to-end task tracking.
- Uses playbook-based workflows for repeatable engineering operations.
- Targets coding-agent environments like Claude Code CLI.
- Implemented in Go with command-line tooling.
