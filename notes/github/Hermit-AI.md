# Hermit-AI - Offline AI Chatbot for Wikipedia and ZIM Archives

## Summary
Hermit-AI is a fully offline AI chatbot that extracts and injects context from .zim files (Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, Project Gutenberg, etc.) into local LLMs. It uses a multi-model reasoning pipeline architecture to find the best data for context injection, requiring no cloud, API keys, or tracking.

## Key Points
- 100% offline .zim data extraction and context injection for LLM queries
- Uses multi-model "Joints" architecture to structure reasoning pipelines
- Leverages Kiwix .zim collections (Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, medical, etc.)
- Can handle ~300GB of local data for context injection
- No cloud dependencies, API keys, or tracking
