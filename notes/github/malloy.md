# Malloy

## Summary
Malloy is a modern open-source language for describing data relationships and transformations. It serves as both a semantic modeling language and a query language, using existing SQL engines (BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, MySQL, DuckDB, etc.) to execute queries. It includes a VS Code extension for building models, querying data, and creating visualizations.

## Key Points
- Semantic modeling language + query language that compiles to SQL
- Supports BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Trino, Presto, and DuckDB natively
- VS Code extension for interactive development and visualization
- Can be tried directly in the browser via github.dev
- Active Slack community for support
