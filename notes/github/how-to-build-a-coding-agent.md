# How to Build a Coding Agent

## Summary
A step-by-step workshop by Geoffrey Huntley that teaches you how to build your own AI-powered coding assistant from scratch using Go and the Anthropic Claude API. Progresses from a basic chatbot to a full agent with file reading, shell commands, file editing, and code search.

## Key Points
- Builds 6 incremental versions: chat → file reader → file explorer → command runner → file editor → code search
- Uses Go and the Anthropic Claude API as the foundation
- Teaches tool-use patterns for LLM agents (read_file, list_files, bash, edit_file, code_search)
- No AI expertise required — designed as a hands-on learning workshop
- Similar in concept to Roo Code, Cline, Amp, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode
