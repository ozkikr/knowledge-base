# starlark-go
## Summary
starlark-go is Google’s Go implementation of the Starlark language, a Python-like configuration and extension language. It is built for embedding in host applications that need deterministic scripting and rich structured data expressions. The project underpins real-world systems such as Bazel-style configuration workflows.
## Key Points
- Provides an embeddable interpreter API via go.starlark.net/starlark.
- Targets configuration and extension use cases with a small, readable language surface.
- Supports concurrent execution models suited for parallel workloads.
- Includes CLI interpreter tooling, REPL usage, and embedding examples for Go applications.
