# CodeMCP (CKB)
## Summary
CodeMCP (marketed as CKB, Code Knowledge Backend) turns a codebase into a queryable knowledge layer for humans and AI tools. It provides CLI, API, and MCP interfaces to answer architecture, ownership, and change-impact questions. The project emphasizes faster and safer software changes through structured code intelligence.

## Key Points
- Provides semantic and graph-style code understanding (usage tracing, architecture maps, ownership lookup).
- Supports impact analysis, risk scoring, reviewer suggestions, and dead code detection workflows.
- Integrates with AI assistants, CI/CD systems, and scripts through CLI, HTTP API, and MCP modes.
- Includes setup flows intended for Claude Code and similar agentic coding environments.
- Focuses on reducing tool-call overhead through compound operations.
