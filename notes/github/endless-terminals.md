# Endless Terminals
## Summary
Endless Terminals is a pipeline for procedurally generating terminal tasks for reinforcement learning. It aims to train terminal-using agents without heavy human annotation by creating executable environments and tests automatically. The repository includes generation, solution, training, and evaluation workflows.

## Key Points
- Generates autonomous terminal tasks with tests and container artifacts.
- Supports model-driven task and solution generation loops.
- Includes dataset prep and training configs for RL experimentation.
- Integrates evaluation workflows and paper resources for benchmarking.
