# ralphio
## Summary
RALPHIO is a minimal orchestration tool for iterative AI coding loops based on a “one task per loop” philosophy. It combines task execution, memory updates, and auto-commit behavior for continuous progress. The project emphasizes simplicity, constrained execution, and traceable autonomous development cycles.
## Key Points
- Processes a single scoped task per loop to avoid context drift.
- Includes planning, memory, and artifact/log structures inside `.agent/`.
- Supports PRD parsing and multi-loop run modes until completion.
- Builds in failure limits, timeout controls, and git-based traceability.
