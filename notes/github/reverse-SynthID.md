# reverse-SynthID

## Summary
reverse-SynthID investigates hidden watermark signals in AI-generated and AI-edited images using classical signal analysis. The repository documents large-scale Nano-150k experiments and SynthID-focused analysis for Gemini outputs. It aims to detect and characterize watermark structures without access to proprietary watermarking internals.

## Key Points
- Analyzes frequency-domain and spatial-domain artifacts to identify potential watermark signatures.
- Reports high detection rates on large edited-image datasets with multi-indicator scoring.
- Includes scripts for codebook extraction and watermark detection workflows.
- Provides visual artifacts showing extracted patterns, spectra, and phase relationships.
- Frames findings as reverse-engineering and empirical analysis rather than vendor tooling.
