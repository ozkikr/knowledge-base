# Knowledge-Base-Self-Hosting-Kit
## Summary
Knowledge-Base-Self-Hosting-Kit is a Docker-first, self-hosted RAG stack for private document and code retrieval. It combines ingestion, vector/keyword search, and a FastAPI backend with a web UI so teams can query local knowledge without relying on external services. The project also includes MCP integration to connect AI agents to the knowledge base.

## Key Points
- Provides end-to-end ingestion and search with ChromaDB + Docling, including code and document sources.
- Ships with a web UI, API endpoints, health checks, and OpenAPI docs for operations.
- Supports local LLM workflows (Ollama by default) and OpenAI-compatible backends.
- Includes MCP server support and an Agent Configuration UI for agent tool integration.
