# agent-lightning
## Summary
Agent Lightning is a framework for training and optimizing AI agents with minimal changes to existing agent code. It supports multiple agent ecosystems and aims to make reinforcement-style and prompt optimization workflows easier to apply in practice. The repository includes tooling, docs, and examples for integrating training into existing agent stacks.
## Key Points
- Targets near-zero-code-change optimization of existing agent workflows.
- Works across popular agent frameworks and standalone Python-agent setups.
- Supports techniques such as RL-style optimization, prompt tuning, and fine-tuning paths.
- Includes installable package distribution and documentation-driven onboarding.
