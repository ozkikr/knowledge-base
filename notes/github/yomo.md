# YoMo
## Summary
YoMo is a serverless AI agent framework for low-latency function-calling systems with geo-distributed deployment patterns. It focuses on secure, fast tool execution and strongly typed integrations, especially for TypeScript and Go ecosystems. The framework is designed for production-grade agent infrastructure where response time and operational simplicity matter.

## Key Points
- Implements low-latency communication patterns on top of QUIC and TLS 1.3.
- Provides CLI workflows to serve and run tool-enabled agent functions.
- Emphasizes typed tool contracts to reduce runtime errors and simplify integration.
- Targets globally distributed inference and tool execution near end users.
