# TaskWeaver: Code-First Agent Framework for Data Analytics

## Summary
TaskWeaver is Microsoft's code-first agent framework that interprets user requests through code snippets and coordinates plugins as functions for stateful data analytics tasks. It uniquely preserves both chat history and code execution history including in-memory data.

## Key Points
- Code-first approach: interprets requests as executable code snippets
- Preserves both conversation and code execution history with in-memory state
- Ideal for complex data structures like high-dimensional tabular data
- Plugin system with function-based task coordination
- Supports vision input, shared memory between roles, and AgentOps integration
