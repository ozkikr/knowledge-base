# sherlock-project
## Summary
Sherlock is a deep-learning system for semantic column type detection in tabular data, aimed at data validation and integration tasks. The repository contains code, notebooks, pretrained artifacts, and reproducibility resources for model retraining and evaluation. It uses rich multi-input feature representations spanning embeddings and statistical signals.
## Key Points
- Classifies column semantics (e.g., name, address, location, identifier types).
- Uses 1,588-dimensional feature vectors from lexical, embedding, and statistical inputs.
- Includes notebooks for preprocessing, training, testing, and out-of-box inference.
- Ships pretrained model files and references to the associated KDD publication.
