# Perry
## Summary
Perry is a self-hosted workspace orchestration daemon for running isolated development environments with AI coding agents. It provisions containerized workspaces and exposes remote access patterns over Tailscale for CLI, web, and SSH usage. The project is geared toward personal or team-controlled infrastructure for portable coding sessions.

## Key Points
- Creates and manages per-project container workspaces from a central local agent.
- Integrates AI coding tools (e.g., Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI) inside workspaces.
- Offers remote access across devices through Tailscale-networked endpoints.
- Includes both web UI management and command-line automation workflows.
- Highlights security caveats for private-network-only deployment patterns.
