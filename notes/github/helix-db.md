# HelixDB

## Summary
HelixDB is an open-source graph-vector database built in Rust that combines graph, vector, KV, document, and relational data models in a single platform. It eliminates the need for separate databases when building AI applications.

## Key Points
- Built in Rust with LMDB storage engine for ultra-low latency
- Combines graph + vector with KV, document, and relational support
- Built-in MCP tools for agent-driven graph exploration
- Built-in embeddings (no pre-embedding needed) and vector/keyword search
- Type-safe query language (HelixQL) with compile-time verification
