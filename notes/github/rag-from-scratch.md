# RAG from Scratch

## Summary
An educational project that demystifies Retrieval-Augmented Generation by building it step-by-step from scratch. Uses local LLMs with no cloud APIs, providing clear explanations of embeddings, vector search, retrieval, re-ranking, and context-augmented generation.

## Key Points
- Step-by-step learning path from basic concepts to full RAG pipeline
- Covers embeddings, vector stores, retrieval, re-ranking, and normalization
- Uses local LLMs — no cloud dependencies
- Companion to "AI Agents from Scratch" by same author
- Every function explained with no hidden abstractions
