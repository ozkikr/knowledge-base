# GLiNER2 — Unified Schema-Based Information Extraction

## Summary
GLiNER2 unifies Named Entity Recognition, Text Classification, Structured Data Extraction, and Relation Extraction into a single 205M parameter model. It provides efficient CPU-based inference without requiring GPUs or external API dependencies.

## Key Points
- One model for four tasks: NER, classification, structured data, and relations
- CPU-first: fast inference on standard hardware, no GPU required
- 100% local processing with zero external dependencies
- 205M parameter base model, with XL 1B available via API
- Simple Python API: `pip install gliner2`
