# Embedding Atlas

## Summary
Embedding Atlas by Apple is a tool for interactive visualization of large embeddings. It supports automatic clustering and labeling, kernel density estimation, real-time search with nearest neighbors, and WebGPU rendering for millions of points with multi-coordinated metadata views.

## Key Points
- Automatic data clustering and labeling for navigating data structure
- WebGPU rendering (WebGL 2 fallback) handles millions of points
- Real-time search and nearest neighbor queries
- Available as Python CLI, Jupyter widget, and npm package (React/Svelte)
- Order-independent transparency for accurate overlapping point rendering
