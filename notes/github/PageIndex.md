# PageIndex

## Summary
PageIndex is a vectorless, reasoning-based RAG system inspired by AlphaGo. It builds hierarchical tree indexes from documents and uses LLMs to reason over them for agentic, context-aware retrieval—simulating how human experts navigate complex documents.

## Key Points
- No vector database or chunking required; uses reasoning-based retrieval
- Builds "Table of Contents" tree structure then performs tree-search retrieval
- Supports vision-based RAG directly over PDF page images (OCR-free)
- Available as chat platform, MCP server, and API
- Addresses the "similarity ≠ relevance" problem of traditional vector RAG
