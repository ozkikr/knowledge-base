# Continuous Claude

## Summary
A persistent, learning, multi-agent development environment built on Claude Code. Solves context loss on compaction through YAML handoffs, memory systems, and 109 skills with natural language triggers. Redirects to v3.

## Key Points
- Solves Claude Code's compaction problem with YAML handoffs for token-efficient context transfer
- Memory system with daemon that auto-extracts learnings across sessions
- 5-layer code analysis + semantic index to reduce token burn
- 109 skills, 32 agents, 30 hooks for orchestration
- Philosophy: "Compound, don't compact" — learnings accumulate like compound interest
