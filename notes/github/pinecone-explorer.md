# Pinecone Explorer
## Summary
Pinecone Explorer is a desktop application for inspecting and managing Pinecone vector databases on macOS. Built with Electron and React, it offers index management, record browsing, and semantic search workflows in a graphical interface. The tool targets developers who want a richer operational UI than API-only workflows.

## Key Points
- Supports profile-based connections and lifecycle operations for Pinecone indexes.
- Handles dense, sparse, and hybrid index record operations with metadata filtering.
- Includes semantic search and reranking support with multiple embedding providers.
- Implements a multi-panel desktop UI with secure API key storage via system keychain.
