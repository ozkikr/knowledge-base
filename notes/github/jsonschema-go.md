# jsonschema-go
## Summary
jsonschema-go is Google’s Go library for working with JSON Schema. It supports schema construction, value validation, and schema inference from Go structs. The project is lightweight, standard-library oriented, and intended as a practical toolkit for Go applications needing schema validation.

## Key Points
- Implements JSON Schema functionality directly in Go.
- Supports generating schemas and validating JSON values against them.
- Includes struct-based schema inference for typed Go workflows.
- Keeps dependency footprint minimal by relying on the Go standard library.
- Uses GitHub issues/templates for bug reports and feature requests.
