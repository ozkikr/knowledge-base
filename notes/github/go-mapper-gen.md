# go-mapper-gen

## Summary
A type-safe code generator for Go that automates mappings between different struct types (e.g., domain entities ↔ database models). Uses pkl as a schema-driven configuration language with strong validation and IDE support.

## Key Points
- Type-safe code generation with compile-time guarantees
- Uses pkl configuration language for mapping definitions
- Flexible output: functions or interface/implementation pairs
- Built-in support for common field types, extensible via custom functions
- Usable as standalone CLI or embedded Go library
