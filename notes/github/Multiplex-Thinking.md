# Multiplex Thinking
## Summary
This repository contains the official implementation of the Multiplex Thinking research work on token-wise branch-and-merge reasoning. The method aims to improve reasoning expressiveness while preserving compact token representations. It includes setup scripts, training/evaluation entrypoints, and links to paper, checkpoints, and project resources.

## Key Points
- Implements token-level branch-and-merge reasoning for multi-path inference/training.
- Provides reproducible environment guidance (Docker/Conda + dependency pinning).
- Includes scripts for model training and benchmark evaluation workflows.
- Builds on related open-source stacks such as verl and sglang.
- Publishes checkpoints and citation materials for research reuse.
