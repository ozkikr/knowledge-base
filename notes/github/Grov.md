# Grov

## Summary
Grov is a collective AI memory system for engineering teams. It captures context from private AI coding sessions and syncs it to shared team memory, auto-injecting relevant knowledge across developers and future sessions to save tokens and time.

## Key Points
- Solves siloed AI knowledge—when one dev's AI learns something, all devs benefit
- Works as a proxy for Claude Code or via native MCP for Cursor, Zed, Antigravity
- Measured impact: tasks drop from 10+ minutes to 1-2 minutes with team context
- Free for individuals and teams up to 3 developers
- Simple setup: `npm install -g grov && grov init && grov proxy`
