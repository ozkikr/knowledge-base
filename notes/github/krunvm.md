# krunvm - Create microVMs from OCI images

## Summary
krunvm is a CLI tool for creating and managing lightweight microVMs from OCI container images. It leverages libkrun to provide fast, isolated virtual machine instances built directly from container images, bridging the gap between containers and VMs.

## Key Points
- Creates microVMs directly from OCI/container images
- Built on top of libkrun for lightweight virtualization
- Provides VM-level isolation with container-like ergonomics
- Part of the containers GitHub organization
- Targets use cases where container isolation isn't sufficient but full VMs are too heavy
