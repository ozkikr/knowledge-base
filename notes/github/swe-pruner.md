# swe-pruner
## Summary
SWE-Pruner is a context-pruning framework for coding agents that aims to reduce token costs while preserving task-relevant code details. It combines task-goal conditioning with a lightweight model for semantic line selection and reports substantial compression on software-engineering benchmarks. The project includes code, model links, and integration examples for agent workflows.

## Key Points
- Targets adaptive, intent-aware pruning instead of fixed generic compression.
- Designed for multi-turn coding agent loops and real-world engineering tasks.
- Highlights semantic critical lines to keep logic-bearing context intact.
- Reports notable token savings on SWE-bench-style evaluations.
- Provides tutorials, downstream evaluation structure, and integration examples.
