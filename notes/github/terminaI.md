# TerminAI
## Summary
TerminAI is a local-first AI terminal operator designed to execute real system tasks with explicit governance and approvals. It emphasizes safe execution through a deterministic approval ladder, PTY support, and auditable local logs.

## Key Points
- Uses a governed intent-to-plan-to-execution loop rather than silent command execution.
- Supports true PTY terminal interaction for workflows like sudo prompts and interactive tools.
- Works across Windows, Linux, and macOS with model-provider flexibility.
- Keeps execution reviewable via explicit approvals and local audit trails.
- Targets practical system operations and workflow automation beyond coding-only assistants.
