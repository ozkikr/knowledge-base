# Agno

## Summary
A framework for building multi-agent systems that learn and improve with every interaction. Unlike stateless agents, Agno agents remember users across sessions, accumulate knowledge, and transfer insights across users — getting smarter over time.

## Key Points
- Agents with persistent learning: user profiles, memories, and knowledge that transfers across users
- Model-agnostic: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models
- Agentic RAG with 20+ vector stores, hybrid search, reranking
- Full production stack: framework, AgentOS runtime, and control plane UI
- Async-first, natively multimodal (text, images, audio, video)
