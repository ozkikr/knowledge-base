# Long-Term-Memory-API
## Summary
Long-Term-Memory-API (MemVault) is a managed GraphRAG memory layer intended to give AI agents persistent, structured memory with minimal setup. It combines vector search and graph extraction, then runs periodic consolidation to improve memory quality over time.
## Key Points
- Provides SDK/API workflows for storing and retrieving agent memories.
- Uses hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword/graph signals).
- Adds asynchronous "sleep cycle" consolidation for deduplication and cleanup.
- Targets production usage with cost controls and queue-based processing.
