# chunkhound
## Summary
ChunkHound is a local-first codebase intelligence tool that combines semantic, regex, and research-style code exploration. It is designed to help assistants understand architecture and patterns rather than only keyword matches. The project supports many languages and integrates with MCP-capable development tools.
## Key Points
- Uses cAST-based chunking and multi-hop semantic retrieval for deeper code understanding.
- Combines semantic and regex search with real-time indexing and branch-aware updates.
- Supports broad language coverage via Tree-sitter and config/text parsers.
- Integrates with assistant ecosystems through MCP for IDE and agent workflows.
