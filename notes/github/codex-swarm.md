# Codex Swarm
## Summary
Codex Swarm is a prompt-defined multi-agent framework for local IDE workflows using the OpenAI Codex plugin, adding structured planning, task tracking, and git-based execution guardrails.

## Key Points
- Uses JSON-defined specialist agents (orchestrator, planner, coder, reviewer, tester, integrator) stored in-repo.
- Adds task lifecycle management and workflow commands through `.codex-swarm/agentctl.py`.
- Emphasizes explicit planning, human approvals, commit discipline, and verification before closure.
- Supports direct and branch/PR workflow modes for different levels of process strictness.
