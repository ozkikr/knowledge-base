# Datatune
## Summary
Datatune is a Python framework for LLM-powered data transformation at large scale, with row-level semantic operations. It exposes primitives such as map and filter while also offering an agent mode that plans transformation chains from natural language instructions. The project targets workflows that bridge traditional dataframe processing with agentic automation.

## Key Points
- Uses natural-language prompts to drive structured operations on tabular datasets.
- Supports both explicit transformation pipelines and higher-level agent orchestration.
- Integrates with Dask and Ibis backends for scalable execution across different data stores.
- Works with multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Ollama, and Azure.
