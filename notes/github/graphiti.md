# Graphiti

## Summary
Framework by Zep for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs for AI agents. Continuously integrates user interactions and enterprise data into a coherent, queryable graph with incremental updates and historical queries.

## Key Points
- Temporally-aware knowledge graph: handles changing relationships and maintains historical context
- Supports semantic, keyword, and graph-based search methods
- Incremental updates without full graph recomputation
- MCP server available for Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients
- Powers Zep's context engineering platform; demonstrated state-of-the-art agent memory
