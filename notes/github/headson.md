# headson
## Summary
headson (`hson`) is a structure-aware head/tail-style tool for JSON, YAML, text, and source code that creates compact previews while preserving structural readability under strict size budgets.

## Key Points
- Provides byte/char/line budgeted summaries with per-file and global caps.
- Supports JSON/YAML/text output modes, grep-like matching, and tree-style multi-file previews.
- Uses structure-aware parsing for JSON/YAML and indentation-aware heuristics for code files.
- Available as both a Rust CLI and a Python package/binding.
