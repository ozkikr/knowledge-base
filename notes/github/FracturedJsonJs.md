# FracturedJsonJs

## Summary
FracturedJson is a JSON formatter that produces highly readable but compact output. It writes arrays and objects on single lines when possible, aligns similar structures like tables, and handles long arrays across multiple lines. Also supports JSON-with-comments.

## Key Points
- Smart formatting: single-line for short structures, multi-line for complex ones
- Table-like alignment for structurally similar entries
- Long arrays written with multiple items per line
- Optional JSON-with-comments support
- Part of a family of FracturedJson tools (JS, .NET, etc.)
