# Code World Model (CWM)
## Summary
CWM is Meta’s open-weights 32B code-focused language model aimed at research in code generation and program-state reasoning. The repository includes inference tooling, evaluation pathways, and reproducibility assets tied to the accompanying technical report. It targets research scenarios spanning coding benchmarks and reasoning tasks.

## Key Points
- Provides pretrained, SFT, and instruction-tuned model variants via public weight releases.
- Focuses on reasoning over code execution effects and environment interactions.
- Includes scripts/docs for serving, evaluation, and capability demos.
- Reports benchmark-oriented research goals across SWE, coding, and math tasks.
- Publishes model card and licensing guidance for responsible use.
