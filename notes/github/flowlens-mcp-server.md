# flowlens-mcp-server
## Summary
flowlens-mcp-server connects browser-recorded user flows to MCP-enabled coding agents. It allows agents to inspect rich browser context (network, console, storage, and event traces) for debugging and regression analysis without reproducing issues manually. The project integrates with a companion Chrome extension and standard MCP clients.
## Key Points
- Bridges captured browser sessions into MCP workflows for agent-assisted debugging.
- Designed to reduce token/time overhead from manual issue reproduction.
- Supports installation and use across common MCP-compatible coding environments.
- Distributed as a Python package with straightforward pipx-based setup.
