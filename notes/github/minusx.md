# MinusX

## Summary
An agentic Business Intelligence platform described as "Claude Code for data." Built from the ground up for native AI interop, it exposes the entire BI surface (questions, dashboards, reports) as a file system that an agent can read and write, enabling natural language data exploration.

## Key Points
- Rebuilds BI from scratch with AI-native design rather than bolting chatbots onto existing tools
- Exposes BI artifacts as a file system for agent read/write
- Agents can explore dashboards, modify existing ones, or generate new ones
- Focuses on context as the hard problem, not just SQL generation
- Prioritizes non-technical user understanding and trust
