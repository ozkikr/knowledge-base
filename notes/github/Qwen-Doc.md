# Qwen-Doc

## Summary
Qwen-Doc is an open-source collection of projects on document understanding, parsing, and agents by the Tongyi-Zhiwen team. It focuses on enhancing LLM capabilities for processing complex documents through long-context reasoning and reinforcement learning.

## Key Points
- Includes QwenLong-L1: first large model trained for long-context reasoning using RL
- QwenLong-L1.5 provides post-training recipe for long-context reasoning and memory management
- SPELL: self-play RL framework for improving long-context reasoning in LLMs
- Releases models, datasets (DocQA-RL-1.6K), and methodologies as open source
- State-of-the-art on multiple long-context document QA benchmarks
