# Agent Sessions
## Summary
Agent Sessions is a local-first macOS app for browsing and searching historical AI coding sessions. It unifies transcripts from multiple CLIs, making it easier to resume work or extract useful context. The project emphasizes privacy by keeping indexing and analysis on-device.

## Key Points
- Aggregates sessions from Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, and others.
- Offers global search across sessions plus in-session navigation for tool outputs.
- Supports resume-oriented workflows and snippet reuse in terminal environments.
- States a local-only privacy model with no telemetry.
