# Voltra

## Summary
Voltra lets React Native teams build native iOS Live Activities, Dynamic Island layouts, and Android widgets using JSX. It translates React-authored UI into platform-native surfaces while preserving familiar development ergonomics. The package is aimed at reducing native-code friction for cross-platform product teams.

## Key Points
- Generates SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose Glance outputs from React Native component code.
- Includes hooks and config plugin support for Expo Dev Client and bare React Native apps.
- Supports push-driven updates for ActivityKit and FCM-based widget refresh flows.
- Provides typed schema, docs, and examples for developer productivity.
- Focuses on shipping native lock-screen/home-screen experiences without manual UI rewrites.
