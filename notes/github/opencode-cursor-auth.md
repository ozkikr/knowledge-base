# opencode-cursor-auth
## Summary
opencode-cursor-auth is a plugin that bridges Cursor Agent authentication into OpenCode workflows. It lets users with Cursor access run Cursor-backed models from a CLI-first environment instead of the Cursor GUI.

## Key Points
- Integrates Cursor Agent as a local provider in OpenCode configuration.
- Enables login via cursor-agent flow for CLI usage.
- Supports model aliases such as GPT and Sonnet variants through local baseURL routing.
- Designed for users with active Cursor subscriptions and existing local tooling.
- Focuses on zero-config local credential reuse rather than cloud-side auth setup.
