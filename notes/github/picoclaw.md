# mosaxiv/clawlet (formerly picoclaw)
## Summary
This repository (redirected from picoclaw) presents Clawlet, a lightweight personal AI assistant inspired by OpenClaw/nanobot-style architectures. It is distributed as a single binary and supports workspace-driven context injection, channel integrations, cron, and gateway operation. The project focuses on simplicity, low runtime overhead, and practical agent tooling.

## Key Points
- Designed as a minimal, dependency-light assistant runtime.
- Uses workspace files (AGENTS.md, memory, tools docs) to drive agent behavior.
- Supports multiple model backends (OpenAI/OpenRouter/Anthropic/Gemini/local).
- Provides built-in integrations for WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and Slack.
- Includes scheduling primitives (cron) and long-running gateway mode.
