# Auditor
## Summary
TheAuditor is a database-first static analysis and code intelligence platform focused on security and deterministic code understanding. It indexes repositories into SQLite databases and provides query-driven workflows for architecture, taint flow, and impact analysis. The README highlights local-first privacy and AI-agent-friendly grounding via deterministic queries.
## Key Points
- Uses indexed SQLite data for fast repeated queries instead of re-parsing files per request.
- Supports multi-language analysis with strongest semantic depth in Python and TypeScript/JavaScript.
- Provides commands for taint tracking, boundary analysis, impact estimation, and planning workflows.
- Designed to reduce AI hallucination by returning verifiable codebase facts.
- Repository announcement notes a pivot toward closed-source product development.
