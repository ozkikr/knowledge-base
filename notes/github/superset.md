# Superset

## Summary
A command center for coding agents that lets you run a team of Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any CLI agent on your machine simultaneously. Provides worktree isolation, agent monitoring, built-in diff viewer, and workspace presets.

## Key Points
- Run 10+ coding agents simultaneously with parallel execution
- Each task gets its own git worktree for isolation
- Built-in diff viewer and editor for reviewing agent changes
- Works with any CLI-based coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode)
- macOS focused, requires Bun v1.0+ and Git 2.20+
