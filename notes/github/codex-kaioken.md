# codex-kaioken
## Summary
codex-kaioken is a fork of OpenAI's Codex CLI focused on heavier UX improvements, persistent memory, and multi-agent workflows. The project is built in a Rust workspace and ships a renamed CLI binary to avoid conflicts with upstream Codex.
## Key Points
- Adds persistent memory primitives for lessons, decisions, and patterns.
- Supports parallel subagent workflows and plan-oriented command modes.
- Preserves compatibility with core Codex ecosystem features (sandbox/MCP-style tooling).
- Designed for autonomous-feeling terminal workflows with stronger ergonomics.
