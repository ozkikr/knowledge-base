# Puck
## Summary
Puck is an open-source visual editor for React that enables drag-and-drop page-building experiences using custom components. It is designed to be embedded directly in existing React applications while preserving ownership of content and data.

## Key Points
- Provides a modular React-based editing surface rather than a hosted CMS lock-in.
- Supports component-driven configuration for custom block and field systems.
- Includes starter recipes for Next.js, Remix, and React Router setups.
- Separates editing (Puck) and rendering (Render) flows for flexible architecture.
- Positioned for teams building internal or commercial visual authoring tools.
