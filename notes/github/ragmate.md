# RAGmate

## Summary
RAGmate is an open-source local RAG server that extends JetBrains AI Assistant with project-aware context. It indexes your codebase locally and injects relevant context into prompts for better, context-aware answers without cloud dependencies.

## Key Points
- Local semantic search over your codebase using embeddings (OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- Works with any LLM API (OpenAI, Ollama, LM Studio) — no framework complexity
- Real-time file change tracking and automatic reindexing
- Tracks current Git branch for enhanced contextual accuracy
- Fully local — code never leaves your machine
