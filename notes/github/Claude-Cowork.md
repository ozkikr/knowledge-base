# Open Claude Cowork (Agent Cowork)

## Summary
An open-source desktop AI assistant alternative to Claude Cowork. Provides a native GUI for AI-assisted programming, file management, and task execution — solving the limitations of terminal-only Claude Code by adding visual feedback and multi-session tracking.

## Key Points
- Native desktop application — no terminal required
- Reuses existing ~/.claude/settings.json configuration
- Visual feedback for complex tasks and tool output inspection
- Multi-session tracking with easy task creation and execution paths
- Built with Bun/Node.js 22+; redirects from Claude-Cowork to Open-Claude-Cowork
