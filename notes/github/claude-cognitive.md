# claude-cognitive
## Summary
claude-cognitive adds working memory to Claude Code through persistent context and coordination primitives. It is designed to reduce repeated rediscovery work in large codebases and support longer-running sessions.
## Key Points
- Implements a context router with hot/warm/cold file attention behavior.
- Includes pool coordination features for multi-instance or collaborative flows.
- Targets token savings by avoiding repeated full-context reloading.
- Helps preserve state across longer agent sessions.
