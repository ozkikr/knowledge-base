# CopilotKit
## Summary
CopilotKit is a frontend SDK for agent-native apps with chat, generative UI, shared state, and human-in-the-loop interaction patterns. It connects UI components, tools, and backend agents into a unified interaction loop and aligns closely with the AG-UI protocol ecosystem. The framework emphasizes rapid initialization for both new and existing apps.
## Key Points
- Supports React-based chat UIs with streaming responses and tool-call flows.
- Enables backend tool rendering and dynamic UI updates from agent actions.
- Offers shared state primitives and pause/confirm human-in-the-loop controls.
- Provides CLI bootstrapping and deep integration with AG-UI-compatible backends.
