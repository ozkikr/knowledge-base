# CodeWeaver
## Summary
CodeWeaver is a CLI that converts an entire codebase into one navigable Markdown document. It captures directory structure and embeds file contents in fenced blocks for easy sharing and downstream analysis. The tool is useful for documentation workflows and LLM context packaging.

## Key Points
- Recursively scans project directories and renders tree-style structure in Markdown.
- Embeds file contents with language-aware code fences for readability.
- Supports include/ignore regex filters to control which files are exported.
- Can output included/excluded path lists for traceability.
- Offers clipboard integration for quick handoff into chat or docs tools.
