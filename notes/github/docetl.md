# DocETL
## Summary
DocETL is an LLM-powered data processing and ETL framework designed for complex document workflows. It combines a visual playground (DocWrangler) for iterative pipeline design with a Python package for production execution. The project emphasizes prompt-driven transformation pipelines and practical deployment paths via local dev and Docker.

## Key Points
- Provides both an interactive UI and a Python runtime for building and running ETL pipelines.
- Focuses on document-heavy workflows where semantic extraction and transformation are needed.
- Supports local and containerized development, including guidance for Bedrock-backed setups.
- Includes tutorials, examples, and community projects that extend core pipeline patterns.
