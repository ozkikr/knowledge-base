# wxpath
## Summary
wxpath is a declarative web crawling system where traversal and extraction are expressed directly in XPath-like expressions. It introduces URL traversal operators and concurrent execution so users can describe crawl logic without writing imperative loops. The project is positioned as deterministic, structured, and suitable for downstream data and RAG workflows.
## Key Points
- Declarative crawler/query language built around XPath semantics.
- Supports recursive and paginated traversal through expression syntax.
- Streams results concurrently while handling scheduling and deduplication.
- Provides CLI and TUI tooling for interactive experimentation.
- Produces structured outputs useful for RAG ingestion.
