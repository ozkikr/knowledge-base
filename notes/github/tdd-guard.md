# TDD Guard

## Summary
Automated Test-Driven Development enforcement for Claude Code. When the AI agent tries to skip tests or over-implement, TDD Guard blocks the action and explains what needs to happen instead.

## Key Points
- Test-first enforcement: blocks implementation without failing tests
- Minimal implementation: prevents code beyond current test requirements
- Multi-language support: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go, Rust, Storybook
- Customizable validation rules and flexible model selection
- Session control: toggle on/off mid-session
