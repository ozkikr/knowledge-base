# Pytelos
## Summary
Pytelos is a Python-based file indexing and retrieval system combining semantic search, keyword search, and agentic reasoning over indexed content. It is built for code/doc exploration with PostgreSQL extensions such as pgvector and pg_textsearch.

## Key Points
- Indexes multiple file formats into searchable chunks with metadata.
- Supports vector, BM25, and hybrid retrieval modes.
- Includes chat/solve workflows for multi-step reasoning over project data.
- Uses PostgreSQL-backed storage and optional Docker-based local setup.
- Provides both CLI and terminal UI interfaces for interactive use.
