# 4PocketCode
## Summary
4PocketCode is a practical guide and setup toolkit for running AI coding agents from an Android phone using a low-cost cloud server. It combines Termux, Tailscale, and server automation scripts to create a persistent mobile-first coding environment. The workflow targets tools like OpenCode, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex.
## Key Points
- Documents an end-to-end mobile setup using a ~$4/month server.
- Uses Tailscale to keep access private without exposing public ports.
- Automates server bootstrap with a single setup script.
- Targets phone-based usage through Termux and mobile editors.
- Supports multiple coding-agent CLIs in one environment.
