# SAM 3
## Summary
SAM 3 is Meta’s foundation model for promptable segmentation and tracking across images and videos. It extends prior Segment Anything capabilities with open-vocabulary concept segmentation using text and visual prompts. The repository includes inference code, fine-tuning tools, checkpoints access instructions, and notebooks.

## Key Points
- Supports text, point, box, and mask prompting for segmentation workflows.
- Introduces open-vocabulary concept segmentation at significantly broader scale.
- Includes image and video predictors with interactive/agent-style examples.
- Provides training/evaluation extras and notebook-based demonstrations.
- Depends on modern Python/PyTorch/CUDA environments for high-performance use.
