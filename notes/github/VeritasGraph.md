# VeritasGraph - All-in-One GraphRAG Framework

## Summary
VeritasGraph combines tree-search navigation with knowledge graph reasoning for document retrieval. Unlike traditional vector RAG that relies on similarity, it builds a knowledge graph for multi-hop reasoning with 100% verifiable attribution, running locally or in the cloud.

## Key Points
- Combines hierarchical tree navigation (TOC) with semantic knowledge graph reasoning
- Multi-hop reasoning across document sections via cross-section linking
- 100% verifiable attribution for every claim
- Built-in visual graph explorer UI
- Fully local/on-premise capable, MIT licensed
