# Mux — Desktop App for Parallel Agentic Development

## Summary
Mux by Coder is a desktop and browser application for parallel agentic development. It enables developers to plan and execute tasks with multiple AI agents on local or remote compute, with isolated workspaces and central git divergence views.

## Key Points
- Isolated workspaces: local, git worktree, or SSH remote execution
- Multi-model support (Sonnet 4, Grok, GPT-5, Opus 4, Ollama, OpenRouter)
- VS Code extension for jumping into Mux workspaces
- Custom agent loop inspired by Claude Code (Plan/Exec mode, vim inputs, /compact)
- AGPL-3.0 licensed by Coder Technologies
