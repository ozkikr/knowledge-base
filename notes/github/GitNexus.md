# GitNexus
## Summary
GitNexus is a zero-server, in-browser code intelligence engine that builds a knowledge graph from repos or ZIPs and supports graph-aware analysis. It emphasizes precomputed relational context so downstream LLM calls need fewer iterative graph queries. The stack runs client-side with WASM components for parsing and graph storage.

## Key Points
- Builds structural/call/dependency graphs directly in-browser.
- Uses precomputed graph intelligence to reduce multi-query reasoning loops.
- Includes hybrid retrieval and confidence scoring for relationship quality.
- Supports multi-language parsing with Tree-sitter and graph storage in WASM.
- Can be used standalone and via MCP integration.
