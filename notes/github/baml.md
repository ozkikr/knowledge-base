# BAML - Basically a Made-up Language

## Summary
BAML is a prompting language for building reliable AI workflows and agents. It turns prompt engineering into schema engineering, focusing on data models to get reliable structured outputs. Supports Python, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, Java, C#, and Rust.

## Key Points
- LLM prompts modeled as typed functions with parameters and return types
- Full type safety, streaming, retries, and wide model support
- Works with any model, even without native tool-calling APIs
- Jinja-like template syntax for prompt composition
- Interactive playground at promptfiddle.com
