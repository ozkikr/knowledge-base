# Claude Code Reverse

## Summary
A tool to visualize and reverse-engineer Claude Code's LLM interactions. The v2 approach uses runtime behavior and API data monkey-patching rather than static code analysis, providing a log visualization tool for researchers.

## Key Points
- V2 uses runtime API request interception (monkey patching) rather than static analysis
- Interactive visualization tool at GitHub Pages
- Captures and displays full LLM interaction logs
- V1 (archived) attempted static JS analysis with LLMs
- Useful for understanding Claude Code's architecture and prompting
