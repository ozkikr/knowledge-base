# vault-workflow
## Summary
vault-workflow is a template repo for orchestrator-and-skill based Codex execution workflows. It combines structured agent contracts, artifact-first outputs, and probe-first context slicing to reduce unnecessary full-context reads. The format is designed to be both AI-agent-friendly and human-navigable via Obsidian wiki links.
## Key Points
- Defines a clear orchestrator/skill separation with reproducible run artifacts.
- Promotes probe-first context access and evidence-linked summaries.
- Uses patch-gated write workflows for safer repository modifications.
- Includes a docs-first structure for reusable, repo-agnostic execution patterns.
