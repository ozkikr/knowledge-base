# rustnet
## Summary
RustNet is a cross-platform terminal network monitor that combines real-time connection views with protocol-aware analytics and process attribution. It sits between simple socket tools and packet analyzers, giving operators a fast operational view over SSH-friendly TUI workflows. The project includes DPI features, filtering, and interface-level telemetry.
## Key Points
- Tracks TCP/UDP/ICMP/ARP connections with protocol and lifecycle states.
- Provides process attribution and service resolution for active connections.
- Includes deep packet inspection signals (HTTP/TLS DNS SSH QUIC and others).
- Supports advanced filtering/sorting and multi-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD).
