# AgentPool

## Summary
A unified agent orchestration hub that lets you configure and manage multiple AI agents (native, ACP, AGUI, Claude Code, Codex) via YAML, and exposes them through standardized protocols (ACP/OpenCode Server). It acts as a protocol bridge between heterogeneous agent systems.

## Key Points
- Configure heterogeneous AI agents in a single YAML file
- Supports native (PydanticAI), direct (Claude Code, Codex), ACP (Goose), and AG-UI agents
- Exposes agents through ACP, OpenCode, and AG-UI server protocols
- Enables inter-agent delegation, message routing, and shared context
- Installable via PyPI
