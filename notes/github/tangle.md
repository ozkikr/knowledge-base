## Summary
Tangle is a web app for building and running ML pipelines without setting up a development environment. Users drag-and-drop components onto a canvas, connect them, and submit pipelines for execution on HuggingFace infrastructure.

## Key Points
- Visual drag-and-drop ML pipeline builder
- Runs on HuggingFace Spaces with HF Jobs for compute
- Multi-tenant architecture with per-user SQLite databases
- Supports Docker/Podman for local execution
- Pipeline artifacts stored in user's HuggingFace Dataset repos
