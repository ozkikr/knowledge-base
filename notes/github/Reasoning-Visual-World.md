# Reasoning-Visual-World
## Summary
Reasoning-Visual-World is the official repository for research on visual generation as a mechanism for stronger multimodal reasoning. It introduces the VisWorld-Eval suite to evaluate visual world modeling capabilities across synthetic and real-world tasks. The project centers on interleaved visual-verbal chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Key Points
- Accompanies the paper "Visual Generation Unlocks Human-Like Reasoning through Multimodal World Models."
- Defines task categories that require simulation and reconstruction capabilities.
- Publishes VisWorld-Eval benchmark resources and references.
- Emphasizes unified multimodal reasoning rather than text-only CoT.
- Provides links to paper, project page, and dataset artifacts.
