# secai
## Summary
secai (AI-gent Workflows) is a Go-based platform for building reasoning agents with graph/state-machine control flows. It focuses on precise behavior modeling, structured memory, and robust workflow execution. The project includes tooling for debugging, observability, and interactive interfaces around long-lived agent systems.
## Key Points
- Uses graph/state-machine abstractions for non-linear and fault-tolerant agent flows.
- Supports structured prompts and schema-driven IO for predictable behavior.
- Provides dev tooling such as debugger interfaces, diagrams, and telemetry hooks.
- Targets privacy-conscious local workflows with strong control over execution paths.
