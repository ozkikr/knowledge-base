# Indexify

## Summary
Indexify is a compute engine for building data platforms in Python. It enables large-scale data processing workflows and agentic applications with durable execution—functions automatically retry on failure and workflows scale across machines. It's the open-source core powering Tensorlake Cloud.

## Key Points
- Python-native: define workflows as functions with type hints, no DSLs or YAML
- Durable execution with automatic retry and persistent state
- Distributed map/reduce with automatic data shuffling across machines
- Request queuing and autoscaling for GPU utilization
- Use cases: document processing, media pipelines, agentic applications
