# Frictionless
## Summary
Frictionless is an app ecosystem for Claude-focused workflows where apps can be created, modified, and extended live. It uses a Lua backend with template-driven UI definitions and emphasizes full hot-loading without restarts. The project aims to reduce orchestration friction between AI assistants and user-facing tools.

## Key Points
- Allows Claude-assisted app building and iterative modification in a running environment.
- Keeps backend state while applying frontend and backend changes dynamically.
- Includes an app console for discovering, testing, and downloading apps from GitHub.
- Supports standalone serving and binary bundling workflows for distribution.
