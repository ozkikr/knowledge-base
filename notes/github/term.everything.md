# term.everything

## Summary
A tool that lets you run any GUI application inside a terminal, including over SSH. It renders graphical windows as terminal output, with quality scaling based on terminal resolution.

## Key Points
- Run any GUI app in the terminal, even over SSH
- Quality scales with terminal rows/columns (higher resolution = better quality)
- Supports full-resolution rendering in image-capable terminals (kitty, iTerm2)
- Can run entire desktops, browsers, and even Doom in the terminal
- Works by capturing and converting GUI output to terminal-compatible formats
