# LARS - AI That Speaks SQL
## Summary
larsql introduces AI-native SQL operators so users can perform semantic retrieval and transformation directly in SQL queries. It targets analytics teams that want LLM-powered behavior without leaving familiar SQL clients and workflows.

## Key Points
- Adds SQL operators like MEANS, ABOUT, CONTRADICTS, and SUMMARIZE.
- Exposes functionality over PostgreSQL wire protocol for existing SQL tooling.
- Supports data federation patterns and model-call logging/cost attribution.
- Focuses on declarative semantic querying instead of bespoke orchestration code.
- Includes optional Studio UI while retaining CLI/database-first operation.
