# Spec Kit

## Summary
Spec Kit is an open-source toolkit from GitHub for Spec-Driven Development — an approach where specifications become executable and directly generate working implementations. It flips traditional development by making specs the primary artifact rather than disposable scaffolding.

## Key Points
- Spec-Driven Development: specifications generate working implementations
- CLI tool (`specify`) for initializing and managing spec-driven projects
- Supports AI agents (Claude, etc.) for implementation generation
- Installed via `uv tool install specify-cli`
- From GitHub — official open-source project
