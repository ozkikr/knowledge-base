# Agent of Empires (AoE)

## Summary
A terminal session manager for AI coding agents built on tmux and written in Rust. Supports running multiple AI agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Mistral Vibe) in parallel across git worktree branches with optional Docker sandboxing.

## Key Points
- TUI dashboard for creating, monitoring, and managing agent sessions
- Git worktrees enable parallel agents on different branches of the same repo
- Docker sandboxing for agent isolation
- Status detection shows which agents are running, waiting, or idle
- Built-in diff view for reviewing changes without leaving the TUI
