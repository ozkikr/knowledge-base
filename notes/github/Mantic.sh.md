# Mantic.sh
## Summary
Mantic.sh is a context-aware code search engine geared toward AI-agent and developer workflows. It prioritizes retrieval relevance using structural and semantic signals rather than plain text matching alone. The project includes MCP-friendly integrations and supports large-repository navigation use cases.
## Key Points
- Focuses on intent-aware code retrieval with semantic reranking support.
- Uses structural parsing (Tree-sitter) for code-intelligence tasks like references and navigation.
- Includes local pattern memory to improve repeated team queries over time.
- Packaged as an npm-distributed tool with editor/client install paths.
