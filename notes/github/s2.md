# S2
## Summary
S2 is a durable streams API and serverless datastore for real-time streaming workloads. The repository includes both the official CLI and a self-hostable server implementation (s2-lite) built for object-storage-backed durability.

## Key Points
- Offers s2-cli for interacting with streams and basins.
- Includes s2-lite, a single-node self-hostable API-compatible server.
- Persists data durably to object storage (or local/in-memory for testing).
- Supports containerized deployment and quick local emulation workflows.
- Targets high-throughput streaming use cases with operational simplicity.
