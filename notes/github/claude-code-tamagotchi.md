# Claude Code Tamagotchi

## Summary

- Lives in the Claude Code statusline as an interactive virtual pet
- Experimental feature — actively being tuned based on real-world usage
- Acts as a safety net ensuring Claude stays on track with what the user actually asked for
- Community-driven improvement through false positive reporting
