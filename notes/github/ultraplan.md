# ultraplan
## Summary
ultraplan is a local-first CLI for capturing multimodal context—audio transcripts, keystrokes, clipboard events, and screenshots—to build richer prompts for coding agents. It focuses on producing structured session artifacts in both Markdown and JSON. The project emphasizes privacy by keeping capture and transcription on-device.

## Key Points
- Captures audio with local Whisper transcription and optional raw WAV output.
- Records keyboard and clipboard events, with flags to disable sensitive capture paths.
- Supports screenshot triggers via hotkeys and voice commands during recording.
- Outputs timeline-style recording.md and machine-readable recording.json per session.
- Includes Claude Code skill integrations and slash-command workflows.
