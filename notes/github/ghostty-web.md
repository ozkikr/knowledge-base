# ghostty-web
## Summary
ghostty-web brings Ghostty terminal emulation to the browser with xterm.js API compatibility. It uses a WASM-compiled parser from Ghostty to improve standards compliance and rendering behavior in web terminals. The project is intended as a drop-in migration path for applications currently using xterm-style APIs.
## Key Points
- Offers API-compatible migration from xterm.js with minimal import changes.
- Uses Ghostty core emulation in WASM for better VT100/escape-sequence handling.
- Keeps runtime lightweight with zero JS runtime dependencies aside from bundle output.
- Includes demo setup and client/server examples for practical integration.
