# Gollem - Go Framework for Agentic AI with MCP

## Summary
Gollem (GO for Large LanguagE Model) is a Go framework for building agentic AI applications. It provides a common interface for querying LLMs (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI), tool integration via MCP, automatic session management, portable conversational memory, and a middleware system for monitoring agent behavior.

## Key Points
- Unified interface for Gemini, Anthropic Claude (direct + Vertex AI), and OpenAI
- Built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for tool integration
- Automatic session management with history compaction for long conversations
- Portable conversational memory for stateless/distributed applications
- Middleware system for logging, monitoring, and controlling agent behavior
