# construct
## Summary
construct is an API-first, open-source coding assistant platform built for automation and integration. It exposes multi-agent workflows and tool use programmatically rather than locking users into a single UI.
## Key Points
- Daemon-style architecture with API access to agents, tasks, and conversations.
- Supports CodeAct-style tool calling where agents can execute richer logic.
- Designed for self-hosting and model/provider flexibility.
- CLI is treated as one client on top of the core API layer.
