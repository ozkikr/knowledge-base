# Context Engineering

## Summary
A first-principles handbook for context engineering — the discipline of filling LLM context windows with optimal information. Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's definition and 3Blue1Brown's teaching style, it moves beyond prompt engineering to context design, orchestration, and optimization.

## Key Points
- Based on Karpathy's quote: "Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step"
- Includes a comprehensive course (under construction)
- References a survey-review of 1,400 research papers on context engineering (arxiv)
- Covers context design, orchestration, and optimization as distinct disciplines
- Links to YC AI Startup School talk on how software is changing
