# Manta IDE

## Summary
Manta IDE is a graph-based development environment that lets you code by creating natural-language nodes. It provides a visual node-and-edge interface where each node can be directed by AI to build components, with configurable properties and agent-based indexing for working at various abstraction levels.

## Key Points
- Graph-based IDE with natural-language nodes connected like a jam board
- Each node has editable properties for directing AI coding agents
- Agent-based indexing allows working at any abstraction level
- Built on Claude Code by Anthropic for AI-powered code generation
- Supports architecture diagrams, user flows, and feature graphs
