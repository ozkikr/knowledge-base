# sql-crack
## Summary
sql-crack is a VS Code extension that turns SQL queries into interactive visual execution flows. It helps users inspect query structure, lineage, and potential performance issues across individual queries and entire workspaces. The project targets practical SQL comprehension and debugging workflows with rich UI tooling.

## Key Points
- Visualizes execution flow for complex SQL, including CTEs, subqueries, and multi-query files.
- Includes column-level lineage tracing and workspace dependency/impact analysis views.
- Provides parser fallback and dialect-aware retry logic for resilience across SQL variants.
- Adds heuristic quality/performance diagnostics and inline editor feedback.
- Supports multiple export and layout options for sharing and exploration.
