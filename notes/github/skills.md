## Summary
The official Anthropic repository for Agent Skills, including example skill sets, specification artifacts, and templates. It demonstrates how skills package instructions, scripts, and resources so Claude can load specialized behavior dynamically. The repo spans creative, technical, enterprise, and document-oriented examples.

## Key Points
- Provides concrete skill folder patterns with SKILL.md frontmatter and instructions.
- Includes spec and template materials for building custom, reusable skills.
- Contains production-relevant document skills (docx/pdf/pptx/xlsx) as reference implementations.
- Documents usage across Claude Code, Claude.ai, and the Claude API.
- Useful as both a starter library and architectural reference for skill design.
