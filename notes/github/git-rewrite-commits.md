# git-rewrite-commits - AI-Powered Git Commit Message Rewriter

## Summary
A CLI tool that uses AI (Ollama or OpenAI GPT) to automatically rewrite git commit history with better, conventional commit messages. Ideal for cleaning up messy commit histories before open-sourcing projects.

## Key Points
- Rewrites entire git commit history with AI-generated conventional commit messages
- Supports local Ollama or remote OpenAI as AI providers
- Automatic redaction of API keys, passwords, and private keys in diffs
- Creates backups before history rewrites for safety
- Available via npx for instant use without installation
