# codex-agentic-patterns
## Summary
An educational codebook that extracts and teaches agentic design patterns from production Codex CLI behavior. It combines conceptual pattern explanations with runnable Python implementations and structured learning paths. The project is aimed at developers who want practical, production-minded agent architecture guidance.

## Key Points
- Covers a broad set of agentic patterns with progression from beginner to advanced tracks.
- Includes interactive documentation plus local runnable examples.
- Emphasizes production concerns: safety, error handling, state, and tool orchestration.
- Connects pattern descriptions to real-world implementation motifs in Codex-style systems.
- Provides exercises and a complete agent example for hands-on practice.
