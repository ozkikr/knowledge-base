# yet-another-opencode-cursor-auth
## Summary
This project is an OpenCode plugin that connects OpenCode to Cursor's backend using OAuth authentication and dynamic model discovery. It provides OpenAI-compatible tool-calling behavior and optional standalone proxy mode for development. The maintainer labels it experimental and explicitly warns about potential policy/TOS risk.
## Key Points
- Adds a Cursor provider path to OpenCode through plugin-based authentication.
- Supports dynamic model listing and streaming responses.
- Maps Cursor tools to OpenAI-style function/tool calling interfaces.
- Offers both plugin-first usage (no server) and a standalone local proxy server.
- README includes explicit legal and stability disclaimers.
