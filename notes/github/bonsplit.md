# bonsplit
## Summary
Bonsplit is a macOS-focused tab bar and split-pane library for SwiftUI applications. It provides native-feeling interactions like drag-and-drop tab movement, keyboard pane navigation, and animated layout changes. The library exposes a controller/delegate API for building IDE-like multi-pane interfaces.

## Key Points
- Supports horizontal/vertical splits and tab management primitives.
- Offers configurable behaviors for reordering, pane closure, and lifecycle.
- Includes delegate hooks for tab events, geometry changes, and policy decisions.
- Provides layout snapshot and restoration utilities for state persistence.
- Targets modern Apple tooling (macOS 14+, Swift 5.9+, Xcode 15+).
