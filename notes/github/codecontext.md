# CodeContext

## Summary
AI-powered tool that automatically generates intelligent, token-optimized context maps of codebases for AI development workflows. Uses Tree-sitter for real AST parsing across multiple languages and produces CLAUDE.md files for instant AI understanding.

## Key Points
- Generates token-optimized context maps designed for AI consumption
- Real Tree-sitter AST analysis for JS/TS, Go, C++, Swift, Python, Java, Rust, etc.
- Enhanced diff algorithms with semantic analysis, rename detection, confidence scoring
- Watch mode for real-time context updates during development
- Outputs CLAUDE.md for pasting directly into Claude conversations
