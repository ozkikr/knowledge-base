# claude-quest
## Summary
claude-quest is an RPG-style visualization companion for Claude Code sessions. It maps live tool activity to pixel-art animations so users can see what their assistant is doing in real time.
## Key Points
- Turns common Claude Code actions into animated visual states (read, write, bash, success/error).
- Run alongside normal Claude Code sessions with a simple CLI command.
- Built for long sessions, streaming demos, and more engaging developer feedback loops.
- Combines playful UX with practical real-time session observability.
