# cc-subagents
## Summary
A lightweight repository intended to hold Claude Code subagents for everyday workflows. Public documentation is minimal, with a short README and little additional structure visible. It appears to function as a personal starter space for subagent configuration patterns.

## Key Points
- Positioned as a personal collection of Claude Code subagents.
- Current public content is intentionally minimal and early-stage.
- Useful mainly as a reference pointer rather than a full framework.
- Suggests a modular, reusable-agent approach to repeated coding tasks.
