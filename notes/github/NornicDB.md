# orneryd/NornicDB
## Summary
NornicDB is a graph-plus-vector database positioned as Neo4j-compatible while adding AI-native capabilities such as automatic relationship weaving and integrated embedding workflows. It supports GPU-accelerated retrieval paths and multiple deployment targets (Apple Silicon, CUDA, CPU). The project emphasizes drop-in interoperability with existing graph tooling and hybrid search patterns.

## Key Points
- Implements Bolt/Cypher compatibility to minimize migration friction from Neo4j.
- Bundles vector search features and optional server-side embedding generation.
- Offers numerous Docker images optimized for ARM, CUDA, Vulkan, and CPU-only environments.
- Includes built-in assistant/plugin concepts and broad APOC-style utility support.
- Markets high throughput benchmarks and lower memory footprint versus traditional setups.
