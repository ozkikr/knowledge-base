## Summary
OpenFGA is a high-performance fine-grained authorization engine inspired by Google Zanzibar. It helps teams model and enforce relationship-based permissions using an API-first approach. The ecosystem includes SDKs, CLI tooling, playground support, and multiple storage backends for production deployment.

## Key Points
- Implements relationship-based authorization patterns for complex permission models.
- Exposes HTTP and gRPC APIs with SDK support across major programming languages.
- Supports multiple storage engines (in-memory, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite beta).
- Provides local playground and CLI tooling for model design and testing.
- Widely adopted in production environments and designed for scalable policy enforcement.
