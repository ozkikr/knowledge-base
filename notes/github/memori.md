# Memori

## Summary
A SQL-native memory layer for LLMs, AI agents, and multi-agent systems. LLM and datastore agnostic, Memori automatically extracts and stores memories (facts, conversations, knowledge graph triples) from LLM interactions using a single line of code integration.

## Key Points
- v3 features Advanced Augmentation: threaded, zero-latency extraction replacing the v2 agent
- Stores memories in 3NF schema including semantic triples for a knowledge graph
- Vectorized memories with in-memory semantic search for accurate context retrieval
- Attribution system ties memories to entities and processes; automatic schema migrations
- Works with all major foundational models and databases; `pip install memori`
