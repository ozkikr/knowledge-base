# clearcut
## Summary
ClearCut is a terminal-first assistant flow that forces users to clarify a problem before receiving AI help. It presents a concise filtering step to sharpen intent, then loops to either confirm resolution or improve the filter. The project is positioned as a friction-light way to improve prompt quality and outcomes.

## Key Points
- Frames problem-solving as “think first, answer second” with a guided clarification stage.
- Uses a short structured filter step instead of immediate free-form prompting.
- Keeps interaction simple with two explicit outcomes: solved vs refine and retry.
- Built as a small Python CLI with straightforward local setup.
- Integrates with Groq + Llama-based inference for generation.
