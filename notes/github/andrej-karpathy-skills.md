# andrej-karpathy-skills
## Summary
This project packages a Karpathy-inspired CLAUDE.md guideline set for improving agent coding behavior. The framework emphasizes explicit reasoning, simplicity, surgical edits, and goal-driven verification loops. It is intended to reduce common LLM failure modes like overengineering and silent assumptions.
## Key Points
- Organized around four principles: Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, and Goal-Driven Execution.
- Designed for straightforward installation as a Claude Code plugin or direct CLAUDE.md inclusion.
- Promotes tests-first and clear success criteria to improve autonomous execution quality.
- Useful as a baseline policy layer that can be merged with project-specific rules.
