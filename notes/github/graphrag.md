# GraphRAG

## Summary
Microsoft's GraphRAG is a data pipeline that extracts meaningful structured data from unstructured text using LLMs and knowledge graph memory structures. It enhances LLM reasoning over private data through graph-based retrieval-augmented generation.

## Key Points
- Extracts structured knowledge graphs from unstructured text using LLMs
- Enhances LLM ability to reason about private/narrative data
- Recommends prompt tuning for best results with custom data
- Indexing can be expensive; start small
- Modular pipeline with community contributions
