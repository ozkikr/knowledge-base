# promptbase: All Things Prompt Engineering

## Summary
Microsoft's promptbase is a collection of resources, best practices, and example scripts for eliciting top performance from foundation models. It showcases the Medprompt methodology, which composes dynamic few-shot selection, self-generated chain-of-thought, and other techniques to achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks.

## Key Points
- Medprompt methodology: dynamic few-shot + self-generated CoT + ensemble techniques
- GPT-4 achieves 90.10% on MMLU, 95.3% on GSM8K using these prompting strategies
- Extended Medprompt+ into non-medical domains with strong results
- Benchmarks across MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, BIG-Bench-Hard, DROP, HellaSwag
- Evolving collection with case studies on prompt engineering process
