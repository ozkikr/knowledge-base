# AgentField - Kubernetes for AI Agents

## Summary
AgentField is an open-source control plane that treats AI agents as first-class backend services. It provides infrastructure for routing, async execution, durable state with vector search, observability, and trust infrastructure using W3C DIDs and verifiable credentials.

## Key Points
- Agent routing and discovery through standard REST APIs
- Async execution for long-running tasks (minutes to days)
- Built-in durable state with vector search (no Redis/Pinecone needed)
- Trust infrastructure: W3C DIDs, verifiable credentials, policy enforcement
- SDKs for Python, Go, TypeScript, and REST API
