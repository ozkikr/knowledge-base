# MCP Router

## Summary
MCP Router is a desktop application for unified management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It supports connecting to any remote or local MCP server, organizing them into projects and workspaces, and toggling tools on/off — all with local-only data storage.

## Key Points
- Universal connectivity to any MCP server (remote or local, DXT/JSON/Manual)
- Cross-platform: Windows and macOS
- Context management via Projects and Workspaces (like browser profiles)
- Per-server tool toggling
- All data stored locally — credentials never transmitted externally
