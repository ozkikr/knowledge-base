## Summary
An MCP server for semantic code research and AI-optimized context generation. Implements "Research Driven Development" (RDD) methodology where AI researches real implementations before writing code, using GitHub search, local filesystem, and LSP intelligence.

## Key Points
- Semantic code search across public and private GitHub repos
- LSP intelligence: Go to Definition, Find References, Call Hierarchy
- Research Driven Development manifest: evidence-first, adversarial validation
- Planner vs Verifier agents check each other's work
