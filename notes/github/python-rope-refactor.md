# python-rope-refactor
## Summary
python-rope-refactor is a Codex skill and wrapper script that encourages rope-first mechanical refactoring in Python codebases. It targets safer automated operations like renames, moves, extraction, and import cleanup. The project emphasizes dry-run review before applying changes.
## Key Points
- Provides scripted commands for module/symbol rename, move, extract, inline, and import organization.
- Intended for installation as a Codex skill with SKILL.md workflow guidance.
- Built around a dry-run → review → apply loop to reduce refactor risk.
- Documents limitations around dynamic references and scanning scope.
