# CodeMachine CLI

## Summary
An open-source tool that orchestrates AI coding agents into repeatable, long-running workflows. It captures coding workflows (bug fixes, feature builds) so they can be run again without manually guiding the agent each time.

## Key Points
- Orchestration layer for AI coding CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.)
- Supports multi-agent orchestration with inter-agent communication
- Parallel execution of multiple agents on different tasks
- Long-running workflows that can execute for hours or days
- Workflows range from fully interactive to fully autonomous
