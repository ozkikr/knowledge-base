# tusk-drift-cli
## Summary
tusk-drift-cli is a record/replay testing CLI for API services that turns real traffic traces into executable regression tests. It coordinates local or cloud-based replay runs and integrates with language SDKs for trace capture. The tool is built to help teams validate behavior drift in CI with realistic test input.

## Key Points
- Replays captured traffic against services under test with deterministic mocking for external I/O.
- Supports dynamic comparison rules for unstable fields like UUIDs and timestamps.
- Includes cloud workflows for storing trace tests and classifying regressions in pull requests.
- Offers setup flows for both manual configuration and AI-assisted onboarding.
