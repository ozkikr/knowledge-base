# assistant-ui

## Summary
assistant-ui is an open-source TypeScript/React library for building production-grade AI chat experiences. It handles streaming, auto-scrolling, accessibility, and real-time updates with fully composable primitives inspired by shadcn/ui. Works with AI SDK, LangGraph, Mastra, or custom backends.

## Key Points
- Composable primitives for full customization (not a monolithic widget)
- Built-in streaming, attachments, keyboard shortcuts, and a11y
- Broad model support: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama, etc.
- Enterprise-ready with optional chat history and analytics (Assistant Cloud)
- Quick start via `npx assistant-ui create` or `npx assistant-ui init`
