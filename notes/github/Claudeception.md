# Claudeception
## Summary
Claudeception is a Claude Code skill that captures non-obvious discoveries and turns them into reusable skills automatically. It is designed to reduce repeated debugging effort by preserving hard-won solutions from prior sessions. The project combines activation hooks, extraction heuristics, and quality gates for practical continuous learning.

## Key Points
- Adds a retrospective/extraction loop so useful discoveries become reusable skill files.
- Supports automatic activation via hook scripts and explicit manual invocation.
- Emphasizes trigger specificity so future retrieval matches the right failure patterns.
- Includes quality filters to avoid saving trivial or unverified “skills.”
- Anchors its approach in prior agent-memory and reflection research.
