# Agent Skills for Context Engineering

## Summary
A comprehensive open collection of Agent Skills focused on context engineering principles for building production-grade AI agent systems. Unlike prompt engineering which focuses on instructions, context engineering addresses holistic curation of all information entering the model's context window.

## Key Points
- Covers context fundamentals, degradation patterns, and optimization
- Addresses attention mechanics: "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon, U-shaped attention curves
- Cited in academic research (Peking University) as foundational work on static skill architecture
- Includes foundational, intermediate, and advanced skill categories
- Focus on minimizing tokens while maximizing signal quality
