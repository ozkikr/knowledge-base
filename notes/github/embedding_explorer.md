# embedding_explorer
## Summary
embedding_explorer is a local-in-browser app for comparing text embedding models and search quality. It provides a structured workflow for ingesting data, generating embeddings from multiple providers, and analyzing similarity results side-by-side. The stack is primarily Dart/Jaspr with libSQL in the browser.
## Key Points
- Guides users through data source setup, templating, provider config, and evaluation runs.
- Supports multi-model embedding generation and similarity search comparisons.
- Uses browser-local persistence via libSQL WASM/OPFS for a local-first workflow.
- Designed for practical embedding model benchmarking without external dashboards.
