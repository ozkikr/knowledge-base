# CocoIndex

## Summary
CocoIndex is an ultra-performant data transformation framework for AI with a core engine written in Rust. It supports incremental processing and data lineage out-of-box, following a dataflow programming model where transformations are declared in ~100 lines of Python.

## Key Points
- Rust core engine for high performance data transformation
- Incremental processing — keeps source and target data in sync automatically
- Dataflow programming model with observable data lineage
- Plug-and-play building blocks for sources, targets, and transformations
- Supports vector indexes, knowledge graphs, and custom transformations
