# Anvil — CLI for Config Management and Tool Installation

## Summary
Anvil is a CLI tool that streamlines development environment setup by batch-installing tools via Homebrew and syncing dotfile configurations across machines using private GitHub repos. Get coding in minutes with consistent configs everywhere.

## Key Points
- Batch app installation by groups or individually via Homebrew
- Configuration sync via private GitHub repositories with automatic backups
- Health checks with auto-diagnosis and fix (`anvil doctor`)
- Dry-run mode and private repo enforcement for safety
- App discovery on existing systems with `anvil init --discover`
