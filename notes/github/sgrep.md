# sgrep

## Summary
sgrep is a semantic code search tool that scales from private local processing to cloud-scale GPU acceleration. It uses embeddings to find code by meaning rather than exact text matching.

## Key Points
- Semantic (meaning-based) code search as opposed to regex/text grep
- Scales from local to cloud GPU acceleration
- Built in Rust for performance
- Includes Claude plugin and Factory skill integrations
- Benchmarks available against real codebases (e.g., Next.js)
