# anthropic-cookbook
## Summary
Anthropic’s cookbook repository (now redirected to Claude Cookbooks) collects practical notebooks and guides for building with Claude. It covers foundational and advanced implementation patterns, from classification and summarization to tool use and multimodal workflows. The content is designed as copyable, developer-oriented recipes for real applications.

## Key Points
- Organized around capabilities like classification, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation.
- Includes tool-integration examples (function/tool calls, SQL, customer-service style flows).
- Provides multimodal notebooks for vision tasks and document/image understanding.
- Contains advanced recipes such as eval building, moderation, JSON mode, and sub-agent patterns.
- Serves as a practical companion to broader Anthropic docs and API learning materials.
