# Hephaestus: Semi-Structured Agentic Framework

## Summary
Hephaestus is a semi-structured agentic framework where workflows build themselves as agents discover what needs to be done. Agents can spawn tasks in any phase (Analysis, Implementation, Validation), creating a branching tree that grows based on actual discoveries rather than predefined scenarios.

## Key Points
- Three phase types: Analysis → Implementation → Validation, with agents able to spawn tasks in any phase
- Self-organizing workflow tree that branches based on agent discoveries
- Includes Hephaestus Dev with 5 production-ready workflows (PRD builder, bug fix, repo indexing, feature dev, docs)
- Agents can discover optimization opportunities and create investigation tasks autonomously
- Supports parallel agent execution across multiple components
