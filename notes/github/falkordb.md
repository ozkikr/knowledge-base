# FalkorDB

## Summary
FalkorDB is an ultra-fast, multi-tenant graph database that uses GraphBLAS under the hood for sparse adjacency matrix graph representation. Its primary goal is to provide the best knowledge graph for LLM applications (GraphRAG), powering generative AI, agent memory, cloud security, and fraud detection.

## Key Points
- Uses GraphBLAS for high-performance sparse matrix graph operations
- Designed specifically as a knowledge graph for LLM/GraphRAG use cases
- Multi-tenant architecture for enterprise deployments
- Supports agent memory, cloud security, and fraud detection workloads
- Available via Docker Hub
