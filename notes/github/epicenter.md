# Epicenter

## Summary
Epicenter is an ecosystem of open-source, local-first apps focused on owning your data. Originally known as Whispering (a speech-to-text tool), it expanded to include an assistant and other tools. All data is stored in plain text and SQLite on your machine.

## Key Points
- Local-first philosophy: all data stored in plain text and SQLite in a single folder
- Evolved from Whispering (speech-to-text) into a broader app ecosystem
- Press shortcut → speak → get text — simple voice transcription workflow
- Supports any model you want, free and open source
- Includes Epicenter Whispering (transcription) and Epicenter Assistant
