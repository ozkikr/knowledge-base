# Browsh

## Summary
Browsh is a fully interactive, real-time, modern text-based browser rendered to TTYs and browsers. It runs headless Firefox under the hood and converts web pages to text-based output, making it ideal for low-bandwidth connections via SSH.

## Key Points
- Backed by headless Firefox for full JS/HTML5 support
- Designed for extremely low-bandwidth connections (3kbps+)
- Works over SSH and supports MoSH for even better stability
- Can offload browser CPU usage from low-powered devices
- Available as a single binary (~11MB)
