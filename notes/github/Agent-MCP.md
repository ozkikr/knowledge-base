# Agent-MCP

## Summary
Agent-MCP is a multi-agent collaboration framework using MCP that creates a living knowledge graph where specialized AI agents work in parallel. Think "Obsidian for AI agents" — with shared context, intelligent task management, and real-time visualization.

## Key Points
- Solves context window overflow, knowledge loss, and single-threaded bottlenecks
- Persistent knowledge graph for shared context across agents
- Real-time visualization dashboard showing agent collaboration
- Parallel execution: backend and frontend agents work simultaneously
- Designed for experienced AI developers familiar with MCP and distributed systems
