# 3D Force-Directed Graph

## Summary
A 3D force-directed graph visualization component built with ThreeJS/WebGL. Provides highly configurable rendering of graph data with customizable node and link appearances, physics simulation, and interactive controls for exploring complex network data in the browser.

## Key Points
- Built on ThreeJS/WebGL for performant 3D rendering in the browser
- Highly configurable: link colors, widths, curvature, opacity, labels, visibility
- Force-directed layout with customizable physics simulation
- Supports curved links, self-referencing loops, and custom geometries
- Interactive: camera controls, node/link hover and click events
