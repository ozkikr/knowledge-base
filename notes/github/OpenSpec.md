# OpenSpec
## Summary
OpenSpec is a spec-driven development framework for AI coding assistants that adds lightweight, iterative planning artifacts and command-based workflows before implementation.

## Key Points
- Uses command flows such as `/opsx:new`, `/opsx:ff`, `/opsx:apply`, and `/opsx:archive` to manage change lifecycles.
- Generates and maintains proposal/spec/design/task artifacts to improve AI coding predictability.
- Designed to be lighter and more iterative than heavyweight gated frameworks.
- Distributed as a Node-based CLI package (`@fission-ai/openspec`) with broad tool integration docs.
