# Parlant

## Summary
An LLM agent framework focused on control and compliance for production customer-facing agents. Instead of relying on system prompts, Parlant uses structured guidelines with condition-action pairs that are contextually matched, ensuring agents behave exactly as business requirements dictate.

## Key Points
- Replaces fragile system prompts with structured behavioral guidelines (condition → action)
- Contextual guideline matching engine ensures relevant rules are applied
- Supports journeys, tool use, domain adaptation via glossary
- Designed for customer-facing production agents
- Positions against LangGraph and DSPy with focus on compliance guarantees
