# FleetCode

## Summary
FleetCode is a lightweight desktop terminal application for running multiple CLI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) simultaneously, each in isolated git worktrees. It provides session persistence, terminal theming, and MCP server management.

## Key Points
- Run multiple Claude Code or Codex sessions in parallel
- Each session isolated in its own git worktree
- Persistent sessions that survive app restarts with auto-resume
- Terminal theming (macOS, Solarized, Dracula, One Dark, GitHub Dark)
- MCP server configuration support (stdio and SSE)
