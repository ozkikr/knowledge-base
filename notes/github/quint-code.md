# quint-code
## Summary
quint-code is a structured reasoning framework for coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, and Codex. It emphasizes hypothesis-driven workflows and evidence-backed decisions stored in a project-local knowledge structure. The tool also provides MCP and command integrations for multiple agent clients.
## Key Points
- Introduces explicit reasoning workflows instead of ad-hoc solution jumps.
- Stores decisions and evidence in auditable project artifacts.
- Supports multi-client setup with CLI initialization for Claude, Cursor, Gemini, and Codex.
- Includes workflow commands to bootstrap and run structured problem-solving loops.
