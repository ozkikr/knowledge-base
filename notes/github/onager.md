# onager
## Summary
Onager is a DuckDB extension focused on graph analytics functions exposed as SQL table operations. It emphasizes practical algorithm execution over graph query language semantics. The project includes centrality, community detection, pathfinding, and graph generation capabilities.
## Key Points
- Adds 40+ graph algorithms to DuckDB with a uniform SQL-first interface.
- Supports directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted graph scenarios.
- Can be installed via DuckDB community extensions or built from source.
- Targets analytics use cases distinct from property-graph querying engines.
