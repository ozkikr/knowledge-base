# OpenWork
## Summary
OpenWork is an open-source desktop and server experience for running OpenCode-powered agent workflows. It is designed as a local-first alternative to closed agent orchestration apps while supporting remote connectivity. The project combines session management, permission controls, templates, and extensibility via skills/plugins.

## Key Points
- Supports host mode (local OpenCode server) and client mode (remote server connection).
- Provides live event streaming, execution timelines, and permission request handling.
- Includes a skills manager and integration paths for alternate UIs like CLI/WhatsApp bridges.
- Built with a Tauri desktop stack and optional headless/server usage patterns.
- Emphasizes composability and "ejectability" so OpenCode features remain usable independently.
