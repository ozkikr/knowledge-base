# Plock

## Summary
Plock lets you use an LLM from anywhere you can type on your desktop. Select a prompt, hit a keyboard shortcut, and it replaces your text with the LLM's streaming output in real time. 100% local by default.

## Key Points
- Works from any text input on your desktop — system-wide LLM access
- Streaming output replaces selected text in real time
- Supports clipboard context: copy text first, then prompt with Cmd+Shift+/
- 100% local by default, but supports external APIs via custom scripts
- Configurable triggers and flexible system for different use cases
