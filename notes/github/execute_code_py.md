Claude Code plugin that restricts tooling to Python execution only.

## Key Points
- Creates a constrained environment where only Python code execution is allowed.
- Blocks file/system/web tools to enforce computational-only interactions.
- Useful for sandboxed experimentation and strict tool-governance scenarios.
