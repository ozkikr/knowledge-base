## Summary
opencode-chat is a plugin that turns OpenCode into a more conversational coding assistant with semantic code search. It adds chat-centric workflows, memory, and task tracking on top of the base OpenCode experience.
## Key Points
- Provides specialized chat agents for lightweight and full-tool interactions.
- Adds semantic search to find code by meaning instead of only keyword matching.
- Includes persistent memory and task/todo support for multi-step work.
- Designed as an independent plugin ecosystem extension for OpenCode.
