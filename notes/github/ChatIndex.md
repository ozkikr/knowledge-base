# ChatIndex - Tree Indexing for Long Conversations

## Summary
ChatIndex is a context management system that enables LLMs to efficiently navigate long conversation histories through hierarchical tree-based indexing and reasoning-based retrieval. It addresses the context rot problem by preserving raw data while offering multi-resolution access to conversation history.

## Key Points
- Builds hierarchical tree index over conversation history for efficient retrieval
- Addresses context rot — reasoning degradation as context grows
- Preserves raw conversation data (not lossy like memory-based systems)
- Provides multi-resolution access at different levels of detail
- Reasoning-based retrieval for intelligent context selection
