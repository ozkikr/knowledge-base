# Semantic Grep (w2vgrep)

## Summary
w2vgrep is a command-line tool that performs semantic searches on text using word2vec embeddings. Unlike regular grep, it finds words with similar meaning to the query, supporting multiple languages with configurable similarity thresholds.

## Key Points
- Semantic search via word embeddings (word2vec) instead of exact string matching
- grep-like interface with context display, line numbers, color output
- Configurable similarity threshold for precision tuning
- Multi-language support via different embedding models
- Reads from files or stdin; configurable via JSON and CLI args
