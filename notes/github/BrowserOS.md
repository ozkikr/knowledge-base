# BrowserOS
## Summary
BrowserOS is an open-source Chromium fork that embeds AI agent capabilities directly into the browser experience. It positions itself as a privacy-first approach where users can bring their own APIs or run local models. The project includes workflow automation, MCP integration, and multi-model chat features.
## Key Points
- Runs browser automation/agents locally with support for hosted and local model providers.
- Offers MCP server functionality for external clients like CLI assistants.
- Includes workflow builder, scheduled tasks, and data extraction capabilities.
- Builds on Chromium compatibility so existing browser habits/extensions remain usable.
