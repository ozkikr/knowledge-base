# thicc
## Summary
thicc is an opinionated fork of the micro editor that packages editor, file browser, terminal, and AI-friendly workflow defaults into one interface. It intentionally minimizes customization overhead in favor of a fixed, ready-to-use setup. The project targets developers who want a fast TUI environment with fewer configuration decisions.

## Key Points
- Presents a unified terminal editor workflow with dashboard and pane navigation.
- Designed for AI-assisted coding by keeping terminal-agent usage first-class.
- Ships with strict defaults (theme/layout/opinions) to reduce setup complexity.
- Provides install script, nightly channel support, and built-in update commands.
- Built as a lightweight CLI-first editing environment with minimal friction.
