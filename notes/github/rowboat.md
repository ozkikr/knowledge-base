# Rowboat

## Summary
Open-source AI coworker that builds a long-lived knowledge graph from your email, meetings, and notes. It runs locally, stores everything as Obsidian-compatible Markdown, and can generate artifacts like decks, briefs, and email drafts grounded in accumulated context.

## Key Points
- Builds persistent knowledge graph from Gmail, Granola, and Fireflies integrations
- Local-first: all data stored as plain Markdown with backlinks
- Background agents for automated tasks (email drafts, daily briefs)
- Supports local models (Ollama/LM Studio) or hosted APIs
- Extensible via MCP for external tool integration
