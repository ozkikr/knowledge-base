# arroyo
## Summary
Arroyo is a distributed stream processing engine written in Rust for stateful, low-latency data pipelines. It supports SQL-based streaming workflows, windowing, checkpointing, and connector integrations such as Kafka and Iceberg. The project positions itself as a cloud-native, performance-oriented alternative for real-time analytics workloads.

## Key Points
- Designed for both bounded and unbounded stream computation.
- Emphasizes SQL-first pipelines with high throughput and subsecond outputs.
- Includes stateful operators, fault-tolerant checkpointing, and recovery.
- Provides local binary installation, Docker deployment, and web UI workflow.
- Targets practical use cases like fraud detection, ingestion, and feature generation.
