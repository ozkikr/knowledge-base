## Summary
An open-source local sandboxing tool for running untrusted or AI-generated code safely using microVM technology with container-like ease of use. Includes an optional Cloudflare Worker layer for remote execution.

## Key Points
- Uses microVM (krunvm) for security guarantees stronger than containers
- Installable via Homebrew on macOS
- Optional Cloudflare Worker package for remote sandbox execution
- Early stage / experimental, actively porting to Rust
- Designed specifically for safely running AI-generated code
