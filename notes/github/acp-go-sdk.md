# acp-go-sdk
## Summary
A Go SDK for implementing the Agent Client Protocol (ACP), which standardizes communication between coding clients/editors and AI agents. It provides typed protocol models, connection helpers, and practical examples for both agent-side and client-side implementations. The library is aimed at production integrations that need structured, interoperable agent messaging.

## Key Points
- Offers strongly typed request/update/response models for ACP workflows.
- Supports both agent and client connection setups over stdio-style transports.
- Includes runnable examples, including bridges to Claude Code and Gemini tooling.
- Documents extension method handling and `_meta` capability negotiation patterns.
- Useful for teams building protocol-compliant agent infrastructure in Go.
