# On Developer Experience
## Summary
Lee Robinson outlines practical DX principles across frameworks, documentation, and APIs. The piece focuses on reducing friction for developers through better defaults, migration paths, error messages, and discoverable documentation.

## Key Points
- Make onboarding and first-value loops fast (one-command starts, quick feedback).
- Plan major upgrades with opt-in transitions, long lead time, and codemods.
- Use strong defaults plus escape hatches to balance simplicity and flexibility.
- Document for skimming: lead with code examples, precise language, and clear error guidance.
- Treat API versioning and deprecation as communication-heavy reliability work.
