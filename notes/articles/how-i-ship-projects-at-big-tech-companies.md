# How I Ship Projects at Big Tech Companies

## Summary
A senior engineer's framework for shipping projects at large tech companies. The core insight: shipping is a social construct — a project is shipped when leadership believes it's shipped. The article covers why shipping is hard, the importance of a single DRI, and how communication and trust with leadership matter more than technical perfection.

## Key Points
- Default state of any project is to not ship; shipping requires someone making it their top priority
- Shipping is a social construct: a project ships when company leadership acknowledges it shipped
- One single person (DRI/tech lead) must have end-to-end understanding of the whole project
- Trust with leadership is the top priority: track record, confidence, competence, proactive communication
- A delay communicated clearly is better for your career than a buggy on-time launch with no communication
- Most common failure: missing a key detail (technical, coordination, or legal) that blocks production
