# Choose Boring Technology
## Summary
A long-form argument for preferring well-understood technologies over novelty when solving business problems at scale. The author frames engineering attention as a scarce resource and warns against spending “innovation tokens” on unnecessary stack complexity. The essay is especially useful for architecture decisions in growing teams.

## Key Points
- Defines “boring” tech as predictable and understood, not simplistic or low-quality.
- Explains how unknown unknowns increase sharply with newer tools and immature ecosystems.
- Argues that each additional technology adds long-term operational and cognitive overhead.
- Re-centers tooling decisions on business outcomes rather than developer novelty preference.
- Encourages intentional complexity budgeting in early-stage and scaling organizations.
