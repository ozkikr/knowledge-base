# Introducing the File Search Tool in Gemini API

## Summary
Google launched the File Search Tool, a fully managed RAG system built into the Gemini API. It handles file storage, chunking, embeddings, and context injection automatically. Storage and query-time embeddings are free; you only pay $0.15 per million tokens for initial indexing.

## Key Points
- Fully managed RAG: no need to build your own retrieval pipeline
- Free storage and embedding generation at query time
- Initial indexing costs $0.15 per 1M tokens (gemini-embedding-001)
- Handles chunking, embedding, storage, and context injection automatically
- Use cases: support bots, knowledge assistants, content platforms
