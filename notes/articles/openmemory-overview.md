# OpenMemory MCP Server

## Summary
OpenMemory is a local-first memory infrastructure powered by Mem0 that provides a unified, persistent memory layer across MCP-compatible AI tools. It runs entirely on your machine, enabling seamless context handoff between development, planning, and debugging environments.

## Key Points
- Local-first: all memory stays on your machine, no cloud sync
- MCP-compatible: works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients
- Standard operations: add_memories, search_memory, etc.
- Hosted option available at app.openmemory.dev (zero setup, no Docker)
- Requires Docker + OpenAI API key for self-hosted setup
