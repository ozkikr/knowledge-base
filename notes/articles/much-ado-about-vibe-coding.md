# Much Ado About Vibe Coding

## Summary
Jason Kottke links to Lauren Goode's Wired piece about spending time at Notion learning to vibe-code (AI-assisted programming). The piece explores the experience of a non-programmer using AI coding tools and the broader cultural tensions around AI replacing or augmenting developer work.

## Key Points
- Vibe coding demands precise articulation of what you want — AI needs specificity
- Engineers compare the AI economic panic to the introduction of the compiler
- The framing "every programmer will be 100x as productive" vs "one person replaces 100"
- Both vibe coding and journalism involve prodding and procurement of information
- Raises questions about the impact on web traffic and journalism jobs
