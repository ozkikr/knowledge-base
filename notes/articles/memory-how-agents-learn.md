# Memory: How Agents Learn

## Summary
Ashpreet Bedi (Agno framework) explains three types of agent memory: session memory (conversation context), user memory (persistent user facts), and learned memory (generalizable knowledge). The key insight is "GPU Poor Continuous Learning" — agents improve through retrieval, not weight updates.

## Key Points
- Three memory types: Session (context), User (preferences), Learned (knowledge)
- Learned memory is the key differentiator — knowledge that compounds over time
- "The model doesn't get smarter. The system gets smarter."
- GPU Poor Continuous Learning: improvement without fine-tuning
- Implementation examples using Agno framework with SQLite storage
