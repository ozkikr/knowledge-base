# Improve Your AI Code Output with AGENTS.md (+ Best Tips)

## Summary
A practical guide from Builder.io on writing effective AGENTS.md files to improve AI agent code output. Shows how layering in dos/don'ts, file-scoped commands, and project context eliminates repeated prompt engineering and produces more consistent, project-aligned code.

## Key Points
- AGENTS.md is a growing standard—a README for AI agents, replacing per-tool config files
- Specify dos/don'ts: versions, state management, styling rules, component size preferences
- Use file-scoped commands (tsc, prettier, test) instead of full project builds for faster feedback
- Without AGENTS.md, agents waste time on discovery and make wrong assumptions about stack details
- Trial and error is key—run prompts, note what's wrong, add rules iteratively
