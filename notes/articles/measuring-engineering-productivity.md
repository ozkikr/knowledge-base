# Measuring Engineering Productivity

## Summary
A practical system for measuring engineering productivity developed over 4.5 years at Felt. The core principle: the bulk of paperwork should fall on management, not ICs. Uses async standups, weekly changelogs, manager 1:1s, PR notifications, and deploy verifications to create visibility without burdening engineers.

## Key Points
- Goodhart's Law ruins most measurement systems; design to avoid gaming
- Async standups (daily Slack posts) take 5-10 min and provide day-to-day visibility
- Weekly changelogs via GitHub Releases show volume and type of work per engineer
- Manager time should far exceed engineer time on measurement overhead
- Categorizing PRs (features, bug fixes, dev ex) reveals where time is spent
- Deploy verifications build ownership and quality culture
