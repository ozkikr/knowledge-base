# Workflows
## Summary
This guide presents practical Codex workflows across IDE, CLI, and cloud environments. It covers onboarding codebases, debugging with repro steps, writing tests, UI prototyping, staged refactors, and review loops. The focus is explicit context, clear constraints, and concrete verification at each stage.
## Key Points
- Recommends structured prompts with scope, constraints, and “definition of done.”
- Separates IDE-first loops from CLI transcript-driven workflows.
- Includes bug-fix playbooks emphasizing reproducibility and regression checks.
- Shows local planning + cloud delegation for larger refactor milestones.
- Describes review flows (`/review`, PR comments) and documentation update patterns.
