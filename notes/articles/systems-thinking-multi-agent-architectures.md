# Systems Thinking for Scaling Responsible Multi-Agent Architectures

## Summary
Nimisha Asthagiri (Thoughtworks) presents on applying systems thinking and complexity theory to multi-agent AI architectures. She draws parallels to social media's unintended consequences — addiction, mental health impacts — and argues that reinforcing loops in AI systems need balancing mechanisms and human governance to prevent similar emergent harms.

## Key Points
- Multi-agent systems are moving rapidly from proof-of-concept to production, increasing complexity
- Uses causal loop diagrams to identify reinforcing and balancing feedback loops
- Draws analogy between social media addiction cycles and potential AI system dynamics
- Advocates for proactive governance rather than reactive regulation
- Emphasizes "tragedy of the commons" in responsible AI ownership
