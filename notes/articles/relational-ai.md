# RelationalAI — Decision Intelligence Platform

Decision intelligence platform that builds semantic models from your data inside Snowflake.

## Summary

RelationalAI (Rel) is a decision intelligence platform that analyzes tables and documents inside Snowflake to build a semantic model of your business. It turns raw data into institutional knowledge — a coherent map of your business that enables grounded decision-making. The model is continuously enriched as users correct and refine it.

## Key Points

- **Semantic modeling**: automatically builds knowledge models from Snowflake data
- **Decision intelligence**: answers grounded in semantic model, not just raw data
- **Reasoning transparency**: shows its reasoning steps, lets you enrich logic
- **Persistent learning**: remembers corrections/enrichments (doesn't need re-stating)
- **Rel language**: domain-specific language for expressing business logic as logical relationships
- Uses trusted by 4,000+ companies (per site claims)
- Example use case: supply chain impact analysis with product substitution logic
- Runs on Snowflake (native integration)
