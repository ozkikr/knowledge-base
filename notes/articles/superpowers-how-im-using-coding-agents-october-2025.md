# Superpowers: How I'm Using Coding Agents in October 2025

## Summary
Jesse Vincent (obra) describes his evolved coding agent workflow, systematized into the "Superpowers" Claude Code plugin. The system automates a brainstorm → plan → implement workflow, with skills that trigger automatically when Claude detects you're building something.

## Key Points
- Released as Claude Code plugin coinciding with Anthropic's plugin system launch
- Bootstrap prompt injects skill awareness into Claude sessions automatically
- Auto-creates git worktrees for parallel tasks on same project
- Skills are composable and self-triggering based on context
- Evolution from manual prompting to structured, automated methodology
