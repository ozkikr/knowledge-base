# How to Effectively Conduct Programming Interviews

## Summary
An article inspired by Casey Muratori's interview approach that advocates for drill-down project-based interviews over LeetCode-style questions. The method focuses on having candidates teach the interviewer about their own projects, drilling into implementation details to assess competence.

## Key Points
- Casey's approach: pick a project from the candidate's CV, drill down into specifics, have them teach you
- Ask "What did you do?", "What alternatives did you consider?", "What if requirements changed?"
- LeetCode tests algorithmic knowledge but misses real-world engineering judgment
- Linear's novel approach is also discussed as an alternative
- Focus on two questions: are they competent, and will they be productive at your company
