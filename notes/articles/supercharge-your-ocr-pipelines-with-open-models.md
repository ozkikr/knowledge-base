# Supercharge your OCR Pipelines with Open Models
## Summary
This Hugging Face guide surveys modern open OCR/document-understanding models and explains how to select one based on output format, layout fidelity, and deployment constraints. It frames OCR as part of a broader document AI stack that now includes multimodal retrieval and QA, not just plain transcription. The article also compares prominent models and discusses cost/privacy trade-offs of open-weight deployments.

## Key Points
- Reviews OCR capabilities across handwriting, formulas, tables, charts, and multilingual text.
- Compares output formats (DocTags, HTML, Markdown, JSON) and their downstream implications.
- Emphasizes locality-aware/grounded extraction for better structural fidelity.
- Provides a practical model landscape including OlmOCR, PaddleOCR-VL, Chandra, DeepSeek-OCR, and others.
- Recommends model choice based on use case: reconstruction, LLM input, or programmatic extraction.
