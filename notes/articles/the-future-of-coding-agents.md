# The Future of Coding Agents

## Summary
Steve Yegge's follow-up post to the Gas Town launch, sharing backstory and predictions about IDEs, big companies, and coding agents in 2026. He argues Gas Town will improve automatically as models get smarter, as Gas Town enters training corpora, and as tooling matures.

## Key Points
- Gas Town launched Jan 1, 2026 as a multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code
- Models will keep getting smarter despite plateau claims, making agent workflows more natural
- Gas Town and Beads entering training corpora will improve model understanding of the system
- Current state is functional but requires manual steering; expected to stabilize through 2026
- Can hurl swarms of Claude Code instances at large epics or bug backlogs
