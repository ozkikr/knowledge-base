# Apache Flink Agents 0.1.0 Release Announcement

## Summary
Apache Flink Agents is a new sub-project for building event-driven AI agents on Flink's streaming runtime. It unifies stream processing and autonomous agents, combining Flink's scale, low latency, fault tolerance, and state management with agent capabilities like LLMs, tools, memory, and dynamic orchestration.

## Key Points
- Event-driven AI agents on Flink's streaming runtime — always-on, reliable, scalable
- Exactly-once action consistency via Flink checkpointing + external write-ahead log
- Native Python and Java APIs with familiar agent abstractions
- Integrates mainstream LLMs, vector stores, and MCP server tools
- Designed for enterprise: e-commerce, finance, IoT, logistics with millisecond latency
- Preview release (0.1.0) — APIs may change
