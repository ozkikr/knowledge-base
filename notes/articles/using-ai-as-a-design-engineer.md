# Using AI as a design engineer
## Summary
This post argues for using AI as workflow acceleration rather than idea replacement in design engineering. The author emphasizes strong project rules, prompt structure, and active human oversight to keep quality high. It presents a practical, tool-driven workflow blending IDE agents, MCP integrations, and CLI usage.

## Key Points
- Advocates “AI as accelerator,” especially for rapid prototyping and exploratory UI scaffolding.
- Recommends explicit codebase rules and reusable commands to reduce repeated prompting.
- Highlights Plan mode and prompt decomposition for better outcomes on larger tasks.
- Uses MCP tools (like Figma MCP and context/document fetchers) to improve grounding.
- Stresses understanding and reviewing agent output instead of passive acceptance.
