# Build Your Own AI Data Analyst (Part 1)

## Summary
Cognition's team describes how they trained Devin (their AI software engineer) as an on-demand data analyst by connecting it to databases and resources via MCP. This solved the knowledge fragmentation problem where analytics questions bounced between product engineers, data engineers, analysts, and finance teams for days.

## Key Points
- Knowledge fragmentation across teams (product, data, BI, finance) makes answering analytics questions slow
- Devin excels because it understands both codebase and data, bridging the gap between instrumentation and analysis
- Connected Devin to MCPs for databases and internal resources to create a 24/7 data scientist
- Reduced analytics question turnaround from days/weeks to minutes
- Part 2 contains the step-by-step implementation guide
