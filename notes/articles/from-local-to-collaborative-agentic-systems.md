# From Local to Collaborative - The Agentic Systems Series
## Summary
A chapter on the transition from local-first AI coding assistants to collaborative, server-first systems, focusing on architecture, trade-offs, and organizational requirements.

## Key Points
- Local-first tools optimize for privacy and simplicity but create team-level silos.
- Collaboration pressures include shared context, reviewability, governance, and centralized billing.
- The chapter maps evolution phases: local-first, hybrid sync, and server-first architectures.
- It frames system design as a tension between individual autonomy and organizational coordination.
