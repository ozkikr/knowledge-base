# What is A2A? (Agent2Agent Protocol)

## Summary
The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol is an open standard for enabling AI agents built by different teams and organizations to communicate and collaborate effectively. It uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S) with discovery via Agent Cards and structured task management workflows.

## Key Points
- Solves inter-agent communication across different teams, technologies, and organizations
- Uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S) as transport and format
- Agent Cards provide discovery mechanisms for capabilities advertisement
- Supports long-running tasks, multiple data modalities, and human-in-the-loop
- Key principles: simplicity, leveraging existing standards (HTTP, SSE, JSON-RPC)
