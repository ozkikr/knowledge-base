# How to Build the Organizational Muscle Needed to Scale AI Beyond PoCs

## Summary
ThoughtWorks argues that most AI PoCs fail because they hit organizational walls (compliance, data silos, late stakeholder engagement), not technical ones. Successful AI transformation requires addressing five building blocks simultaneously using a "thin slice" approach that builds muscle through real-world application.

## Key Points
- 95% of AI initiatives reportedly fail to generate ROI — mostly due to organizational, not technical, barriers
- Five building blocks: business-outcome-guided strategy, technology foundations, repeatable pilot-to-production paths, agile product teams, sustained adoption/change management
- "Thin slice" approach: focus only on discrete elements needed for a given use case to reduce risk and deliver value faster
- Organizations learn by doing — each thin slice builds muscle for future iterations
- AI transformation can't be bought; it requires building internal capability incrementally
