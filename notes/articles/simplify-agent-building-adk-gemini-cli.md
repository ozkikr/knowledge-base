# Simplify Your Agent "Vibe Building" Flow with ADK and Gemini CLI

## Summary
Google announces updates to the Agent Development Kit (ADK) that, paired with Gemini CLI, streamline agent building. The key innovation is a revamped llms-full.txt file that gives Gemini deep understanding of ADK, enabling rapid agent prototyping.

## Key Points
- ADK's llms-full.txt was shortened by 50%+ and made more LLM-friendly
- Gemini CLI + ADK creates an "ADK specialist" coding assistant
- Enables generating functional multi-agent code in minutes
- Eliminates friction of documentation reading and framework selection
- Demonstrated by building a GitHub issue labeling agent
