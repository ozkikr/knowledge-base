# What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?
## Summary
Introductory guide to RAG covering fundamentals, components, workflow, variants, benefits, and practical use cases.

## Key Points
- Explains RAG as combining external retrieval with LLM generation for improved factuality.
- Breaks down core components: retriever, generator, knowledge base, and integration layer.
- Walks through end-to-end flow from indexing to retrieval-augmented prompting.
- Discusses benefits such as fresher knowledge and lower retraining cost.
- Surveys challenges and evolving patterns for advanced RAG systems.
