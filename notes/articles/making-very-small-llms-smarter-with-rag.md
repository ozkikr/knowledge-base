# Making Very Small LLMs Smarter With RAG
## Summary
This Docker post focuses on improving very small language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The fetched page content was partially obscured by Docker blog index rendering, but the article framing indicates practical guidance on raising answer quality by pairing compact models with retrieval context. The core theme is improving usefulness without jumping to much larger model sizes.

## Key Points
- The article positions RAG as a way to boost small-model capability with external context.
- It emphasizes practical engineering over brute-force model scaling.
- The post is part of Docker’s broader local/agentic AI workflow ecosystem.
- Context management appears central to getting better quality from constrained models.
