# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

## Summary
A comprehensive video course by Andrej Karpathy that teaches building neural networks from scratch in code. Starting from backpropagation basics, it builds up to modern deep neural networks like GPT, using language models as the primary learning vehicle.

## Key Points
- Covers backpropagation, bigram language models, MLPs, BatchNorm, and manual backprop through a network
- Prerequisites are minimal: solid Python and intro-level math (derivatives, gaussians)
- Focuses on language models as the best entry point to deep learning, with transferable concepts to other domains like computer vision
- Introduces PyTorch tensors, training frameworks, loss evaluation, and diagnostic tools for network health
- Builds progressively from simple models to GPT-level architectures
