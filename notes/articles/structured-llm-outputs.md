# Structured LLM outputs
## Summary
Nanonets’ handbook frames structured output as a prerequisite for dependable LLM automation, especially for extraction, codegen, and tool invocation. It positions itself as a living resource covering methods, tradeoffs, and production implementation concerns. The content emphasizes deterministic techniques to reduce format failures from probabilistic generation.

## Key Points
- Focuses on reliable JSON/XML/code generation for programmatic workflows.
- Surveys tools and strategies for constraining output shape and validity.
- Discusses architecture concerns like latency, cost, and deployment at scale.
- Aims to consolidate rapidly evolving structured-generation practices.
- Targets practitioners building production-grade LLM systems.
