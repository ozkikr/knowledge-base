# Zero to One: Learning Agentic Patterns
## Summary
A practical pattern catalog for building AI systems, distinguishing fixed workflows from autonomous agent patterns and outlining when each tradeoff is appropriate.

## Key Points
- Advocates choosing the simplest viable architecture before adding agency.
- Separates predictable workflow patterns from dynamic agentic patterns.
- Covers prompt chaining, routing/handoffs, and parallelization workflows.
- Introduces reflection, tool-use, planning/orchestrator-worker, and multi-agent patterns.
- Stresses robustness: error handling, retries, logging, and observability.
