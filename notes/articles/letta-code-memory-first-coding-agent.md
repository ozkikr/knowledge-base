# Letta Code: A Memory-First Coding Agent

## Summary
Letta Code is a memory-first coding agent that persists across sessions and improves with use. Unlike typical coding agents with independent sessions, Letta Code agents learn from experience through long-term memory, skill learning, and agentic context engineering. It's the #1 model-agnostic OSS harness on TerminalBench.

## Key Points
- Long-lived agents that persist across sessions with continual learning
- `/init` command triggers deep research on local codebase to form initial memories
- Skill learning: agents learn reusable patterns (API patterns, DB migrations) as .md files
- #1 model-agnostic OSS harness on TerminalBench, comparable to Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI
- Install via `npm install -g @letta-ai/letta-code`
