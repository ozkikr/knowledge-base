# Essential GraphRAG - Neo4j Guide

## Summary
A free comprehensive guide from Manning (via Neo4j) on building GraphRAG systems from scratch. It covers how knowledge graphs bridge structured and unstructured data to improve RAG performance, accuracy, and traceability for LLM applications.

## Key Points
- Standard RAG focuses on unstructured data, risking hallucinations and incomplete information
- GraphRAG models data as knowledge graphs to provide interconnected context to LLMs
- Covers vector similarity, query rewriting, and parent document retrieval
- Includes knowledge graph construction with LLMs and agentic AI with RAG
- Addresses RAG performance evaluation and accuracy measurement
