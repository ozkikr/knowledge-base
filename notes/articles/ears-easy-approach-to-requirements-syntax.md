# EARS - Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax

## Summary
EARS is a lightweight notation for writing high-quality textual requirements. Developed at Rolls-Royce PLC, it uses structured patterns with keywords to gently constrain natural language requirements, reducing ambiguity and common problems.

## Key Points
- Uses a small set of keywords to denote different requirement clauses, always in the same temporal order
- Developed while analyzing airworthiness regulations for jet engine control systems
- First published in 2009, adopted by organizations like Airbus, Bosch, Dyson, NASA, Intel, Siemens
- Especially effective for non-native English speakers writing requirements
- Lightweight with little training overhead, no specialist tool needed
