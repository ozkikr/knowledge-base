# 73 Programming Project Ideas to Inspire and Challenge You

## Summary
A curated list of 73 non-trivial programming project ideas from CodeCrafters, each chosen to teach meaningful concepts. Covers systems programming (containers, DNS servers, RAFT), creative coding (procedural crosswords, deepfakes), and classic CS projects (BitTorrent client, spreadsheet engine).

## Key Points
- Projects range from networking (BitTorrent client, DNS server, Googlebot) to distributed systems (RAFT)
- Includes creative/AI projects: deepfakes via optimal transport, geometric theorem proving, Wordle solver
- Systems projects: build a container runtime, spreadsheet engine, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon graph
- Each project includes references to specs, papers, or tutorials to get started
- Focus on projects that teach a lot and are fun to build, avoiding basic/dull ideas
