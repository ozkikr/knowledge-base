# Data Modeling for the Agentic Era: Semantics, Speed, and Stewardship

## Summary
An article exploring how to model data for AI agents to reliably consume, built around three pillars: semantics (shared language for humans and AI to understand metrics), speed (sub-second analytics for verification), and stewardship (guardrails that guide without constraining).

## Key Points
- Three pillars: Semantics, Speed, and Stewardship for agent-based data modeling
- Metrics SQL as a SQL-based semantic layer for structured, explorable context for LLMs
- Demonstrates conversational analytics with Claude Desktop and Rill's MCP
- BI-as-Code development with Claude Code for agentic workflows
- AI linter for data modeling quality; humans with agents, not humans or agents
