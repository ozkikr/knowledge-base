# Refactoring internal documentation in Notion
## Summary
This writeup details a pragmatic effort to improve internal docs quality after a Confluence-to-Notion migration. The approach prioritizes reducing stale duplication and improving AI-search outcomes over preserving legacy hierarchy. It combines policy changes with automation scripts and targeted manual review.

## Key Points
- Identifies stale/duplicated docs as the primary source of trust erosion in internal knowledge bases.
- Adopts policy principles: minimize duplication, prefer source-of-truth READMEs, and distribute ownership.
- Implements archive workflows using “Scheduled to Archive” and private archive spaces.
- Uses scripts to prune old trees, promote current buried pages, and detect stale links.
- Reports meaningful cleanup impact with modest one-person time investment.
