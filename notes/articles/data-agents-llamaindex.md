# Data Agents — LlamaIndex

## Summary
LlamaIndex announced Data Agents — LLM-powered knowledge workers that perform automated search, retrieval, and write operations over structured and unstructured data. They can call external APIs, store conversation history, and fulfill complex data tasks.

## Key Points
- Data Agents handle both "read" and "write" operations over data
- General Agent/Tool abstractions for building agent loops with structured tool APIs
- LlamaHub Tool Repository with 15+ tools (Google Calendar, Notion, SQL, OpenAPI)
- Can build functional agents like a Gmail agent in <10 lines of code
- Extends LlamaIndex beyond basic RAG into agentic workflows
