# A Short Lesson in Simpler Prompts

## Summary
While building context-viewer, the author went from 300-word prompts that barely worked to 15-word prompts that worked well. The key lesson: learn what models are good at, break problems to fit their strengths, and engineer around limitations.

## Key Points
- Went from 300-word to 15-word prompts with better results
- Work with LLMs instead of fighting them — lean into model strengths
- Break down problems (segmentation and categorisation) to fit model capabilities
- Balance AI with plain old engineering
- Applied to semantic segmentation and classification of LLM context content
