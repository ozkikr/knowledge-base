# Mermaid ER Diagram Syntax
## Summary
Official syntax documentation for creating entity-relationship diagrams in Mermaid, including entity definitions, relationship cardinalities, labels, and attribute notation.

## Key Points
- Mermaid supports crow’s-foot notation for ER cardinalities and relationship semantics.
- Syntax is largely compatible with PlantUML, with Mermaid-specific relationship labeling support.
- Guides how to represent entities with or without attributes, depending on modeling intent.
- Covers Unicode and markdown support inside ER diagram definitions.
