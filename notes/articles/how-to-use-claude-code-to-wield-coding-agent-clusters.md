# How To Use Claude Code To Wield Coding Agent Clusters

## Summary
A PulseMCP deep dive on managing clusters of parallel coding agents using Claude Code. The article targets experienced software engineers working on mature codebases, explaining how to orchestrate up to ~10 agents simultaneously — a new take on the "10x engineer" concept.

## Key Points
- Most useful for mature projects where human teams could already collaborate without conflicts
- Claude Code chosen over Cursor/Windsurf because it optimizes for capability over token cost minimization
- Requires significant context-switching and orchestrating skills — aimed at engineers, not vibe coders
- Principles and patterns designed to outlast specific tooling changes
- References Cline team's writeup on design philosophy differences between subscription vs. API-billed tools
