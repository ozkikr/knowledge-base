# Multi-Agent Systems: The Architecture Shift from Monolithic LLMs to Collaborative Intelligence
## Summary
Comet’s guide argues that single-agent “god prompt” architectures are hitting reliability limits, and outlines how specialized multi-agent designs improve context handling, critique quality, and production control.

## Key Points
- Highlights context-window degradation and “lost in the middle” failure modes.
- Proposes distributed context and specialist-to-supervisor summarization patterns.
- Frames multi-agent critique as a way to reduce single-agent error persistence.
- Compares architectural styles including graph-based control and actor-style systems.
- Positions observability and evaluation as core requirements for production MAS.
