# Benchmarking AI Agent Memory: Is a Filesystem All You Need?
## Summary
Letta reports that a filesystem-based approach with simple file tools can perform strongly on LoCoMo, challenging assumptions that specialized memory stacks are always necessary. The post argues that agent capability and tool-use behavior may matter more than memory backend sophistication. It also critiques benchmark comparability and calls for more holistic memory evaluation.

## Key Points
- Shows strong LoCoMo performance using file operations plus semantic search rather than bespoke memory tools.
- Argues memory outcomes are tightly coupled to agent architecture and tool proficiency.
- Questions benchmark claims that are not reproducible or clearly documented.
- Contrasts retrieval benchmarks with dynamic memory benchmarks and long-horizon task benchmarks.
- Recommends evaluating memory as end-to-end agent behavior, not just isolated retrieval quality.
