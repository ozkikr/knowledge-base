# Tips for Building Knowledge Graphs

## Summary
A practical guide explaining why and how to build knowledge graphs, especially in the context of LLMs needing backing knowledge bases. The article demystifies knowledge graphs by showing they are fundamentally databases—triples are just another way of referencing table cells—while highlighting key differences from relational databases like the absence of NULL and the ability to define predicates in terms of other relationships.

## Key Points
- A knowledge graph is fundamentally a database; a triple references a cell in a table
- Key difference from SQL: no NULL needed—missing data simply has no triple
- Predicates can be defined in terms of other relationships (metadata, provenance, constraints)
- Classes in graphs are analogous to tables in relational databases
- Growing demand driven by realization that LLMs/GenAI need structured knowledge foundations
