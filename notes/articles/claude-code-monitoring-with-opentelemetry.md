# Bringing Observability to Claude Code: OpenTelemetry in Action

## Summary
Guide on monitoring Claude Code usage with OpenTelemetry and SigNoz. Covers building an observability pipeline to track token usage, costs, session metrics, performance trends, and developer behavior patterns across Claude Code deployments.

## Key Points
- Track token usage, cost, sessions, conversations, and requests per user
- Monitor quota consumption (e.g., 5-hour limits) and model distribution (Sonnet vs Opus)
- Capture behavior insights: terminal types, accept/reject decisions, tool popularity
- Uses OpenTelemetry for vendor-neutral instrumentation
- SigNoz dashboards for visualization and alerting
