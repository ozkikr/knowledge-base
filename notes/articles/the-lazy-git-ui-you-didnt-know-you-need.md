# The (Lazy) Git UI You Didn't Know You Need

## Summary
A detailed article by Bartek Płotka about discovering and adopting lazygit as a primary Git interface. The author explains why lazygit's TUI approach, consistency, discoverability, and git-native design make it superior to both CLI and traditional GUI git tools.

## Key Points
- lazygit is a terminal UI for git that's fast, portable, and visually consistent
- Strong UX through consistent box/view layout, native git terminology, and interactive menus
- Makes advanced git operations (bisect, hunks) discoverable without memorizing commands
- Works standalone or embedded in editors (neovim, IntelliJ plugin)
- Author switched from decade-long git gui/gitk workflow within one week
