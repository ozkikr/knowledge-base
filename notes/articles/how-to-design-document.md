# How to Write a Good Design Document

## Summary
Grant Slatton's guide on writing effective design documents. Frames design docs as proofs that convince readers (especially the author) that a design is optimal given constraints. Emphasizes organization as critical as code organization.

## Key Points
- A design doc is a technical report outlining implementation strategy in context of trade-offs and constraints
- Goal: convince the reader the design is optimal — most important reader is the author
- Writing reveals sloppy thinking, just as code reveals sloppy writing
- Organization matters as much as content; avoid "spaghetti design docs"
- Ordering and structure should reflect logical dependencies, not discovery order
