# Why We Built "BlaBlaCar Data Copilot": Shifting Data Analysis Left

## Summary
BlaBlaCar built an internal Data Copilot to bridge the gap between software engineers and data analysts. By "shifting left"—empowering engineers to answer their own data questions—they reduced bottlenecks on data teams and operationalized the Data Mesh concept using LLMs.

## Key Points
- Software engineers have the domain context but fear unfamiliar data tooling (SQL dialects, DBT, Airflow)
- Data analysts are buried under "quick questions" and build unmaintainable ad-hoc SQL
- "Shift left" borrows from DevOps: move data validation closer to feature development
- LLMs lower the barrier by translating between engineering and data domains (the "ecotone" concept)
- Frees data analysts to become mentors/architects instead of human search engines
