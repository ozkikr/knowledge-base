# AI-augmented data quality engineering
## Summary
The article argues that static rule-based data quality checks are insufficient for modern high-volume, rapidly changing enterprise data systems. It outlines an AI-augmented approach spanning semantic inference, ontology alignment, generative repair, anomaly detection, and dynamic trust scoring. The overall goal is a more adaptive, explainable, and self-healing data quality workflow.
## Key Points
- Highlights deep learning methods (e.g., Sherlock/Sato) for semantic type inference.
- Discusses transformer-based schema alignment and generative approaches for cleaning/imputation.
- Covers GAN/VAE anomaly detection and concept-drift-aware monitoring patterns.
- Advocates dynamic trust scoring with explainability tooling such as SHAP and LIME.
