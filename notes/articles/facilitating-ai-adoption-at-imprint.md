# Facilitating AI Adoption at Imprint

## Summary
Will Larson shares his working notes from 18 months of driving internal AI/LLM-tooling adoption at Imprint. The article covers building personal intuition through hands-on projects, developing an adoption strategy centered on removing obstacles rather than mandating usage, and practical details of getting agents to work reliably across the organization.

## Key Points
- Build personal intuition first: small bounded projects (2-10 hours) to understand tool use, agents, and MCP
- Strategy pillars: pave the path (remove obstacles), opportunity everywhere (not just engineering), senior leadership leads from the front
- Biggest fear: creating the impression of AI adoption rather than actual productivity gains
- Uses strategy testing approach: identify goals, pick initial approach, iterate rapidly in details
- Practical challenges include things like getting agents to handle Slack mrkdwn formatting correctly
