# Optimizing Repos for AI

## Summary
Practical strategies for organizing repositories to work well with AI coding agents. Focuses on increasing iterative speed, improving adherence to evergreen instructions, and helping both humans and agents navigate codebases effectively.

## Key Points
- Strong static analysis (linters, type checks) creates fast feedback loops for agents
- Use `just` (justfiles) as the most interoperable way to share commands between agents and humans
- Direct build logs to files to reduce token consumption
- Organize docs in `docs/` directory for discoverability
- What helps agents also helps humans — optimize for both
