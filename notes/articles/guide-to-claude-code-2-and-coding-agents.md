# A Guide to Claude Code 2.0 and Getting Better at Using Coding Agents

## Summary
An in-depth guide to Claude Code 2.0 covering new features, workflows, and context engineering strategies. Discusses sub-agents, commands, hooks, skills, system reminders, and practical tips for maximizing effectiveness with CLI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI.

## Key Points
- Claude Code 2.0 introduces sub-agents, improved commands, hooks, and skills for better context management
- Context engineering is crucial—agents are token guzzlers, so managing what goes into context matters
- Recommended workflow: setup → exploration → execution → review, with CLAUDE.md as the foundation
- Sub-agents can be spawned for isolated tasks without inheriting full context
- Hooks, skills, and system reminders can be combined for powerful automated workflows
