# My AI Adoption Journey
## Summary
Mitchell Hashimoto outlines a staged, practice-heavy path from chatbot skepticism to productive agent-assisted development. The post emphasizes deliberate skill-building, selective delegation, and workflow design over hype. A core idea is “harness engineering”: codifying guardrails and tooling so agents reliably self-correct.

## Key Points
- Recommends moving from chat-only usage to tool-using coding agents.
- Suggests learning by reproducing manual work with agents until strengths/limits become clear.
- Uses time-shift strategies (end-of-day/background agents) to gain parallel progress.
- Advises outsourcing high-confidence “slam dunk” tasks while preserving human deep work.
- Introduces harness engineering via project instructions and verification scripts.
