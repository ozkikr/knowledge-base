# My Gemini 3 Review

## Summary
A hands-on review of Google's Gemini 3 model focusing on real-world usage rather than benchmarks. The author highlights exceptional creative writing quality, improved consistency across tasks, faster speed relative to intelligence, and a more direct, less verbose personality compared to competitors like GPT-5.1.

## Key Points
- Creative writing quality is genuinely good, not just "good for AI"
- The real improvement is in the hard 20% of tasks—complex reasoning and edge cases
- High "intelligence per second" — fast for how smart it is
- More terse and direct personality; respects your time vs GPT-5.1's verbosity
- Antigravity IDE is impressive but requires babysitting—model can declare victory prematurely
