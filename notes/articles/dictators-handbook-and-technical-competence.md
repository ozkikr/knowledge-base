# The Dictator's Handbook and the politics of technical competence
## Summary
An essay applying selectorate theory from The Dictator’s Handbook to technical organizations, exploring how coalition dynamics shape incentives, governance, and decision quality.

## Key Points
- Summarizes inner-circle/outer-circle framing from selectorate theory.
- Argues coalition size often predicts organizational behavior more than formal structure.
- Examines implications for authority, incentives, and public-goods-style outcomes.
- Reflects on how these dynamics may map (imperfectly) onto large tech-company contexts.
