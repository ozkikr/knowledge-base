# Yann LeCun — I-JEPA: The First AI Model Based on a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture

## Summary
Meta AI blog post introducing I-JEPA (Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a self-supervised learning method that learns semantic image representations by predicting representations of masked image blocks rather than pixels. Represents a step toward Yann LeCun's vision of human-like abstract reasoning in AI.

## Key Points
- I-JEPA predicts abstract representations rather than pixel-level details
- Does not rely on hand-crafted data augmentations unlike contrastive methods
- Part of LeCun's broader vision for autonomous machine intelligence
- Achieves strong performance on vision tasks with high training efficiency
- Non-generative approach — focuses on learning semantic features
