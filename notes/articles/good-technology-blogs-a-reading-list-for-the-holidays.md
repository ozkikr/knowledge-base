# Good technology blogs: a reading list for the holidays
## Summary
A curated reading list of technical blogs across performance engineering, algorithms, compression, databases, compilers, operating systems, and AI. The post is opinionated and experience-driven, with context from real production use and open-source contributions. It serves as a discovery map for high-signal long-form technical writing.

## Key Points
- Recommends deeply technical authors in low-level optimization, database internals, and compression.
- Includes historical context on libraries adopted in ClickHouse (e.g., simdjson, LZ4, zstd, re2).
- Mixes active and archival resources, including blogs that are no longer updated but still valuable.
- Emphasizes first-person engineering narratives and practical insights over hype.
