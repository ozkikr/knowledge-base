# Everything I Know About Good API Design

## Summary
Sean Goedecke shares practical API design wisdom from experience building public, private, REST, GraphQL, and CLI APIs. The core thesis: good APIs are boring and familiar, but hard to change once published, creating a tension between simplicity and forward-thinking flexibility.

## Key Points
- Good APIs are boring — any time users spend thinking about the API is wasted time
- APIs are hard to change once published; each breaking change risks losing users
- Balance between familiarity (conventions) and flexibility (future-proofing)
- Applies to REST, GraphQL, and even CLI interfaces
- Practical advice over theoretical purity (skip HATEOAS debates)
