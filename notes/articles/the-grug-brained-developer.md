# The Grug Brained Developer

## Summary
A humorous essay written in caveman-speak about software development philosophy, centered on the idea that complexity is the ultimate enemy. It advocates for simplicity, self-awareness about one's limitations, and pragmatic approaches to building software.

## Key Points
- Complexity is the "apex predator" — the worst enemy of any codebase
- Big-brained abstractions often introduce more harm than good
- Self-awareness about your own cognitive limits is a superpower
- Favors simple, understandable code over clever solutions
- Written in an endearing caveman voice that makes serious points memorable
