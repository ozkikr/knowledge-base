# How to build self-improving coding agents - Part 3
## Summary
This post outlines a practical maturity model for making coding agents improve over time through two artifacts: repository memory (AGENTS.md) and reusable skills. It focuses on turning repeated friction points into explicit constraints or playbooks that compound productivity. The author frames this as metacognitive workflow design rather than model self-learning.

## Key Points
- Proposes a progression from repo-local memory to global personal skills to team-shared skills.
- Recommends observing agent traces and promoting repeated issues into durable instructions.
- Distinguishes AGENTS.md (always-on repo rules/context) from skills (named reusable procedures).
- Highlights “executable markdown” as a practical way to encode workflows agents can run.
- Argues agents are broad general-purpose teammates, not only coding assistants.
