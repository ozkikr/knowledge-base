# A Case of the Reverse Ivory Tower
## Summary
Long-form essay/story about infrastructure abstraction and organizational distance, using the "reverse ivory tower" metaphor to critique platform over-insulation from developer reality.

## Key Points
- Frames the ivory tower problem as distance from lived operational constraints.
- Argues that over-abstraction can optimize internal coherence over user/developer outcomes.
- Uses narrative satire to illustrate platform complexity, process rigidity, and metric theater.
- Highlights feedback-loop failure as a core source of architectural drift.
- Connects sociotechnical design quality to proximity, empathy, and practical usability.
