# LLM-As-Judge: 7 Best Practices & Evaluation Templates

## Summary
A comprehensive guide on using LLMs to evaluate AI agent outputs, covering when and why to implement LLM-as-judge evaluations. Draws from academic research and practical experience monitoring production AI agents at Monte Carlo Data.

## Key Points
- 40% of data+AI teams have AI agents in production as of March 2025
- Traditional data quality monitoring doesn't suit non-deterministic AI outputs
- 7 best practices: few-shot prompting, step decomposition, criteria decomposition, evaluation templates, structured outputs, explanations, score smoothing
- Includes practical evaluation prompt templates
- Addresses when NOT to use LLM-as-judge
