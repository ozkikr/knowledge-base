# How to Build a Coding Agent: Free Workshop

## Summary
Geoffrey Huntley's workshop transcript arguing that building a coding agent is fundamental knowledge for 2025 developers. Demonstrates that a coding agent is essentially 300 lines of code running in a loop with LLM tokens, and walks through building one live.

## Key Points
- A coding agent is ~300 lines of code running in a loop with LLM tokens — it's not that hard
- Understanding agent fundamentals transforms you from AI consumer to AI producer who can automate tasks
- Employers (e.g., Canva) now expect candidates to understand and use AI in interviews
- Work can be done concurrently with AI — agents can build while you're in meetings
- The industry has an adoption cliff: people stuck in "prove it to me" vs. those automating their job functions
