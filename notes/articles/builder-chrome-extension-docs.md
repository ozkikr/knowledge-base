# Builder Chrome extension
## Summary
Documentation for Builder’s Chrome extension covering content editing, page layout copying, imports into Builder/Figma, and iframe preview fixes when sites block embedding.

## Key Points
- Edit published Builder content directly from live pages.
- Copy sections or full layouts with responsive structure preserved.
- Paste copied layouts into Builder Visual Editor or into Figma via plugin.
- Use builder.json upload flow when direct clipboard import falls back to file download.
- Extension can rewrite iframe-related headers on builder.io to enable Visual Editor previews.
