# Generating content with AI models
## Summary
Genkit documentation for model usage patterns, including single-call generation, structured outputs, streaming, multimodal inputs, and model-provider portability.

## Key Points
- `ai.generate()` is the core API for model calls, with flexible model selection by reference or string identifier.
- The guide covers schema-constrained outputs, making extraction flows safer and more predictable.
- Streaming APIs support progressive response handling and final typed response retrieval.
- It shows multimodal prompts and media-generation patterns, plus ecosystem plugin options.
