# data activation thoughts
## Summary
An essay arguing that proprietary data alone is no longer a moat; competitive advantage comes from transforming domain data into forms LLMs can reason over effectively, with healthcare as a key case study.

## Key Points
- The post reframes “data moat” thinking around data activation rather than raw data ownership.
- It highlights healthcare demand and rapid model-provider movement in health-focused AI products.
- It discusses research methods (for example, contrastive traces from structured records) that improve reasoning more than naive table-to-text conversion.
- Core thesis: transformation scaffolding (reasoning traces, ontology mapping, counterfactual structure) unlocks value from structured data.
