# Claude Code Framework Wars

## Summary
A field report on the emerging ecosystem of Claude Code frameworks. Dozens of open-source projects are experimenting with different approaches to structuring AI-assisted development, covering task management, agent coordination, session orchestration, and code delivery.

## Key Points
- Seven key design decisions: task storage, guidance, coordination, sessions, tools, development, delivery, context preservation
- Task sources range from markdown backlogs to GitHub Issues to structured specs
- Coordination approaches: role simulation, swarm parallelism, repo-native artifacts
- Session management: terminal orchestration, parallel worktrees, parallel containers
- Claude Code doesn't require code to become a framework—just structured prompts
