# MatAnyone: Stable Video Matting with Consistent Memory Propagation
## Summary
Project page for a CVPR 2025 video matting method that targets stable human matting using memory-based propagation and region-adaptive fusion.

## Key Points
- Proposes consistent memory propagation to stabilize semantic regions and preserve boundary detail.
- Supports target-assigned/instance matting using first-frame segmentation.
- Introduces training strategies and larger datasets for robustness across real-world scenarios.
- Highlights recurrent refinement to improve alpha mattes without inference-time retraining.
- Reports strong performance compared with existing methods in diverse video contexts.
