# Justified - Why "just" Is a Great Task Runner

## Summary
An article making the case for the Rust-based "just" task runner as a daily driver for project command normalization. It explains how task runners solve the problem of remembering project-specific commands across different frameworks and tools.

## Key Points
- `just` is a cross-platform, Rust-based task runner using `.justfile` for project commands
- Normalizes setup, run, test commands across different projects and frameworks
- Self-documenting with `just --list` to show available recipes
- Supports parameters, defaults, OS-specific recipes, and dotenv loading
- Preferred over `make` (which was designed as a builder, not task runner)
