# Just Talk To It - The No-BS Way of Agentic Engineering

## Summary
Peter Steinberger shares his evolved workflow for agentic engineering, running 3-8 parallel Codex CLI instances in a terminal grid. He emphasizes thinking in "blast radius" — estimating how many files a change touches — and advocates for direct, simple interaction with AI agents rather than elaborate prompting charades.

## Key Points
- Runs parallel agents in same folder with atomic git commits per agent
- Uses "blast radius" thinking to gauge change scope and manage parallel work
- Prefers Codex CLI over Claude Code for its quieter, more productive style
- Uses gpt-5-codex on mid settings as a good smart/speed compromise
- Don't be afraid to stop agents mid-way; file changes are atomic and models resume well
