# Shameless Green: Pragmatic TDD in Go

## Summary
An article about the "shameless green" approach to TDD in Go — writing the simplest possible code to pass tests before worrying about elegance. Uses a text adventure game as an example, demonstrating iterative development guided by tests.

## Key Points
- First priority is passing the test, not writing beautiful code
- "Shameless green" means the simplest code that makes tests pass
- Correctness first, then refactor for elegance
- Don't multi-task between correctness and beauty
- Part of a series building a text adventure game in Go with TDD
