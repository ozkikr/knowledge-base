# "Attention", "Transformers", in Neural Network "Large Language Models"
## Summary
A long-form technical notebook that interprets attention mechanisms through the lens of classical statistical ideas (especially kernel smoothing), while critically examining terminology and assumptions in modern LLM discourse.

## Key Points
- Frames attention as closely related to Nadaraya–Watson kernel smoothing with learned projections.
- Explains query/key/value mechanics in statistical and linear-algebra terms.
- Questions anthropomorphic naming and hype-driven framing in AI writing.
- Extends discussion from attention to transformer behavior and language modeling claims.
- Emphasizes epistemic caution and iterative understanding over authority.
