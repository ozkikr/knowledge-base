# Coding Agents & Complexity Budgets

## Summary
Lee Robinson describes migrating cursor.com from a headless CMS back to raw code and Markdown in 3 days using $260 in tokens and hundreds of coding agents. The article argues that with AI coding agents, the cost of abstractions like CMSes has never been higher.

## Key Points
- Migrated cursor.com from CMS to raw Markdown in a weekend with coding agents
- CMS added hidden complexity: user management, preview, content modeling, schema migrations
- With AI agents, "content is just code" — no GUI abstraction needed
- Key insight: the cost of abstractions rises when agents can directly edit code
- Estimated 1-2 weeks, completed in 3 days with agent assistance
