# Traversals From Nodes
## Summary
This documentation page explains typed node traversal in HelixQL, focusing on graph navigation from selected nodes. It introduces core traversal operators and reinforces schema-safe querying semantics. Multi-language examples illustrate equivalent usage patterns across Python, Rust, Go, TypeScript, and cURL.
## Key Points
- Uses strongly typed traversal steps constrained by schema definitions.
- Documents outgoing (`::Out`) and incoming (`::In`) node traversal behavior.
- Demonstrates social-graph patterns such as followers/following queries.
- Pairs query snippets with complete schema and API usage examples.
- Emphasizes safe, predictable graph operations through type constraints.
