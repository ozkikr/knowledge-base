# RUBIK'S CUBE SOLUTION: PRINTABLE CHEAT SHEET
## Summary
A compact beginner-oriented guide that walks through a full 7-step method for solving a 3x3 Rubik’s Cube. It focuses on practical algorithm sequences for each stage rather than theory-heavy explanations. The page is useful as a quick reference once you already know the basic notation.

## Key Points
- Uses a standard beginner pipeline: cross, first-layer corners, middle edges, last-layer orientation and permutation.
- Provides dedicated algorithms for moving corners and edges without breaking solved parts.
- Includes specific handling for edge-orientation and corner-orientation edge cases.
- Emphasizes rotating the top layer to set up final permutation cases (“headlights” and solved-edge patterns).
