# A Practical Guide to Building a Parser in Go

## Summary
Inspired by a "Pragmatic Programmer" exercise to parse time specifications using BNF grammar, the author builds a parser in Go. The article covers BNF/EBNF/ABNF notation and the challenges of writing parsers in Go compared to dynamic languages.

## Key Points
- Motivated by a BNF grammar exercise from "The Pragmatic Programmer"
- Covers BNF, EBNF, and ABNF notation differences
- Go feels more low-level for parser writing compared to Python/Ruby/Groovy
- Practical example: parsing time specs like "4pm", "7:38pm", "23:42"
- Good intro for developers new to writing parsers by hand
