# The Quality of AI-Assisted Software Depends on Unit of Work Management

## Summary
The craft of AI-assisted software creation is substantially about correctly managing units of work. The article argues that the major bottleneck isn't model intelligence but providing correct context, and that working on small, concrete chunks is key to getting quality results from AI coding tools.

## Key Points
- Context engineering is the most important technique for better AI coding results
- The right-sized unit of work respects the context window — smaller chunks yield better output
- Generated output quality depends heavily on what's already in the context window
- Without necessary context, AI will hallucinate or generate code inconsistent with codebase practices
- Referenced by Andrej Karpathy as "putting AI on a tight leash"
