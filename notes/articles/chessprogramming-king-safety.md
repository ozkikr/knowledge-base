# King Safety - Chessprogramming wiki
## Summary
Technical overview of king safety heuristics in chess engines, from basic pawn shield and pawn storm terms to attack-unit models and scaling strategies.

## Key Points
- Explains pawn shield integrity and penalties for open/semi-open files near king.
- Describes pawn storm pressure and interaction with file-opening threats.
- Covers king tropism, virtual mobility, and attacker proximity heuristics.
- Introduces attack units and weighted king-zone pressure (used in engines like Stockfish/Rebel).
- Emphasizes scaling king danger by attacking force and game state.
