# Cameras and Lenses

## Summary
Bartosz Ciechanowski's interactive deep-dive into how cameras and lenses work, built from first principles. Covers digital image sensors, photodetectors, color filter arrays (Bayer filters), demosaicing, and the physics of light capture—all with interactive demonstrations.

## Key Points
- Digital image sensors use grids of photodetectors that convert photons to electric current
- Bayer filter arrays use 2 green, 1 red, 1 blue filter per 2x2 grid (green correlates with perceived brightness)
- Demosaicing reconstructs full RGB from the sparse color filter array data
- Exposure time controls brightness: too short = underexposed, too long = overexposed
- Builds understanding from first principles with interactive visualizations throughout
