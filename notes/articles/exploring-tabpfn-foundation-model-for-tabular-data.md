# Exploring TabPFN: A Foundation Model Built for Tabular Data
## Summary
Overview of TabPFN evolution and concepts, plus practical implementation notes, explaining how in-context-learning-style tabular foundation models reduce per-dataset retraining.

## Key Points
- Reviews TabPFN progression (original model through newer variants with larger limits).
- Explains prior-data-fitted training on many synthetic datasets.
- Describes training/inference pipeline and zero-shot-style usage on new tables.
- Outlines architecture intuition for tabular attention behavior.
- Includes implementation framing and comparison mindset against tree-based baselines.
