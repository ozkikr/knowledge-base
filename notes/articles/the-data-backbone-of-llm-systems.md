# The Data Backbone of LLM Systems

## Summary
Paul Iusztin's InfoQ presentation on how LLM systems are fundamentally data engineering problems. He argues that with foundational models, most AI applications reduce to RAG, which is essentially software engineering, data engineering, and information retrieval rather than ML engineering.

## Key Points
- Most AI engineering problems are RAG problems at their core
- Foundational models eliminate the need to train/fine-tune for most applications
- The key question is prompt engineering vs RAG vs fine-tuning
- RAG boils down to software engineering, data engineering, and information retrieval
- Author of the LLM Engineer's Handbook with Maxime Labonne
