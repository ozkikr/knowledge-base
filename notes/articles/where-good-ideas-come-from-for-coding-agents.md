# Where Good Ideas Come From (for Coding Agents)

## Summary
Applies Steven Johnson's seven innovation patterns to coding agents, arguing that LLMs are naturally strong at adjacent-possible work and platforms but weak where progress depends on reality pushing back (error, serendipity). Users must supply constraints, context, an oracle, and a feedback loop to make agents converge on useful solutions.

## Key Points
- LLMs are "thought completers" — prompting is navigation through idea-space, not magic words
- Agents excel at adjacent-possible (small diffs, incremental refinements) and platforms (interfaces, scaffolds)
- Agents are weak at error/serendipity unless given feedback channels (tests, benchmarks, traces)
- Key user adaptations: decompose into verifiable stairs, curate "liquid network" context packets, provide oracle checks
- Asking an agent for a "vibe" produces vibe-shaped completions; asking for specific stairs with tests produces working code
- Week-long simulation shows how each of Johnson's 7 patterns maps to agent workflows
