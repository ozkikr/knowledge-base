# Automated Metrics for Evaluating the Quality of Text Generation

## Summary
A DigitalOcean tutorial covering popular untrained automatic metrics for evaluating NLG system output quality. Covers classical metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and perplexity with code examples, explaining their strengths and limitations across tasks like translation, summarization, and captioning.

## Key Points
- ROUGE: Recall-oriented metric measuring syntactic overlap (unigram, bigram, longest common subsequence)
- BLEU: Precision-based metric commonly used for machine translation
- Untrained metrics are generic, language-independent, and fast to compute
- Trained metrics can account for task specifics but require learning data
- Covers practical code implementations for each metric
