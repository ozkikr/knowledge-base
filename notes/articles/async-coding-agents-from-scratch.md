# Async Coding Agents "From Scratch"

## Summary
Benjamin Anderson argues that async coding agents (like Devin) are now achievable with off-the-shelf models. The bottleneck has shifted from model capability to human bandwidth — deciding what to do, describing tasks, and reviewing results. Building your own async agent setup is practical and powerful.

## Key Points
- Async coding agents became viable around Claude Sonnet 3.5 / GPT-4o era
- The bottleneck shifted from model ability to human task management and review
- Cloud agents have friction (env vars, packages, permissions) vs local CLI agents
- Latest models make the ROI of background agents dramatically better
- You don't need Devin — "we have Devin at home"
