# From Scores to Skills: A Cognitive Diagnosis Framework for Evaluating Financial Large Language Models

## Summary
Introduces FinCDM, the first cognitive diagnosis evaluation framework for financial LLMs. Instead of single aggregate scores, it evaluates models at the knowledge-skill level, identifying specific financial skills models have or lack. Includes CPA-KQA, a dataset derived from CPA exams annotated by domain experts.

## Key Points
- Existing financial LLM benchmarks use single-score evaluation that obscures nuanced understanding of model capabilities
- FinCDM evaluates at knowledge-skill level based on response patterns across skill-tagged tasks
- CPA-KQA dataset covers comprehensive accounting/financial skills with expert annotations and high inter-annotator agreement
- Tested on 30 proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs
- Reveals hidden knowledge gaps and under-tested areas like tax and regulatory reasoning
