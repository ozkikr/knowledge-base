# Comparing AI Agents to Cybersecurity Professionals in Real-World Penetration Testing

## Summary
First comprehensive evaluation of AI agents vs human cybersecurity professionals in a live enterprise environment (~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets). Their ARTEMIS multi-agent framework placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants.

## Key Points
- ARTEMIS: multi-agent framework with dynamic prompt generation and automatic vulnerability triaging
- Achieved 82% valid submission rate, outperforming 9/10 human pentesters
- AI agents excel at systematic enumeration and parallel exploitation
- Cost advantage: ~$18/hour for ARTEMIS vs ~$60/hour for professional pentesters
- Key gap: AI agents have higher false-positive rates than top human participants
