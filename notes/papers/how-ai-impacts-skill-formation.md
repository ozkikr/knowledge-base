# How AI Impacts Skill Formation
## Summary
This study uses randomized experiments to examine how AI assistance affects developers learning a new asynchronous programming library. While AI can raise short-term output for users who heavily delegate, it generally harms conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging skill growth. The authors identify interaction patterns showing that cognitively engaged AI use can preserve learning better than passive delegation.

## Key Points
- Tests learning outcomes, not just productivity, under AI-assisted coding conditions.
- Finds average efficiency gains are limited, while core understanding and debugging often decline.
- Shows full delegation can trade off longer-term competence for immediate throughput.
- Identifies six AI interaction styles; three engagement-heavy styles better maintain learning.
- Suggests cautious AI integration in safety-critical and training-heavy environments.
