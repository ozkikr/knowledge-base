# Timelike conformal fields on closed 3-manifolds
## Summary
The paper studies nowhere-vanishing timelike conformal vector fields on closed Lorentzian 3-manifolds and shows strong rigidity in this setting. After a conformal metric change that makes the field unit and Killing, the authors analyze the induced flow via stable Hamiltonian structures and basic cohomology. The main result classifies such fields as Reeb vector fields of either Sasakian or co-Kähler structures.

## Key Points
- Establishes a rigidity theorem for timelike conformal flows in dimension three.
- Uses conformal normalization to transform the problem into a unit Killing-flow setting.
- Connects Lorentzian flow geometry with stable Hamiltonian structures and basic cohomology.
- Shows every admissible flow is intrinsically Reeb-like.
- Concludes the ambient geometry must be contact (Sasakian) or cosymplectic (co-Kähler).
