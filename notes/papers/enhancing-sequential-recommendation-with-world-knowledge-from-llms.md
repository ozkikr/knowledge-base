# Enhancing Sequential Recommendation with World Knowledge from Large Language Models

## Summary
Proposes GRASP (Generation Augmented Retrieval with Holistic Attention for Sequential Prediction), a framework that integrates LLM world knowledge into sequential recommendation systems while handling LLM hallucinations through retrieval-based augmentation and multi-level attention.

## Key Points
- Traditional collaborative filtering-based sequential recommendation suffers from limited information signals
- Existing LLM-integration approaches assume correctness of LLM outputs, vulnerable to hallucination noise
- GRASP uses generation-augmented retrieval for descriptive synthesis and similarity retrieval
- Holistic attention enhancement with multi-level attention captures dynamic user interests
- Achieves state-of-the-art on two public benchmarks and one industrial dataset across diverse backbones
