# Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey

## Summary
Comprehensive survey paper on RAG systems covering Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG paradigms. Examines retrieval, generation, and augmentation techniques, provides evaluation frameworks and benchmarks, and outlines future research directions.

## Key Points
- Categorizes RAG into three paradigms: Naive, Advanced, and Modular
- Addresses LLM challenges: hallucination, outdated knowledge, opaque reasoning
- RAG merges intrinsic LLM knowledge with external dynamic databases
- Covers state-of-the-art in retrieval, generation, and augmentation components
- Introduces evaluation framework and benchmarks for RAG systems
