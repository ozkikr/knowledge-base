# Nemori: Self-Organizing Agent Memory Inspired by Cognitive Science
## Summary
This paper introduces Nemori, a self-organizing memory architecture for long-horizon LLM agents. It addresses memory granularity and passive extraction limits via a two-step alignment method and a predict-calibrate learning process inspired by cognitive theories. Reported results on LoCoMo and LongMemEval show strong performance gains, especially on longer contexts.
## Key Points
- Proposes Two-Step Alignment based on Event Segmentation Theory for coherent episode formation.
- Introduces Predict-Calibrate learning based on Free-energy ideas to learn from prediction gaps.
- Targets adaptive memory evolution rather than static rule-based extraction heuristics.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art benchmark improvements in long-context agent memory tasks.
