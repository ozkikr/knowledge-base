# A Survey of Frontiers in LLM Reasoning: Inference Scaling, Learning to Reason, and Agentic Systems

## Summary
A comprehensive survey categorizing LLM reasoning methods along two dimensions: regimes (inference-time vs dedicated training) and architectures (standalone LLMs vs agentic compound systems). Covers input-level prompt construction and output-level candidate refinement techniques.

## Key Points
- Two dimensions: regimes (inference vs training) and architectures (standalone vs agentic)
- Input level: high-quality prompt construction techniques
- Output level: methods refining multiple sampled candidates
- Highlights shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1)
- Covers transition to agentic systems with external tools and multi-agent collaboration
