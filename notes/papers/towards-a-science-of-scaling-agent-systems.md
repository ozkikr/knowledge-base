# Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

## Summary
This paper derives quantitative scaling principles for LLM-based agent systems. It formalizes agentic evaluation and characterizes scaling laws as the interplay between agent quantity, coordination structure, model capability, and task properties across four benchmarks.

## Key Points
- Evaluates five canonical agent architectures: Single-Agent and four Multi-Agent variants
- Benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench
- Studies how agent quantity and coordination structure affect performance
- Formalizes a definition for agentic evaluation
- Explores scaling laws specific to agent systems (not just model parameters)
